Do you think Moishe Postone makes the same mistake when he argues that the goal should be to abolish abstract labor?
The HP analogy did it for me. Thank you Paul!
"I haven't read Capital, only Heinrich's ""Kritik der politischen Ökonomie"". I can't remember if he drew this false conclusion in that text.
I don't intend on reading Capital tbh. I can't imagine I'm capable of retaining a more detailed picture of capital than I have after reading the mentioned Heinrich, Marx's VP&P and WL&C and of course Arguments For Socialism by you and Zacharia."
For the all powerful algorithm!
"Professor, do you think that the invention of an artificial general intelligence could render Marx’s thesis that only human labor that exists in the abstract false? Or would an AGI still just be considered constant capital? It seems it would certainly be capable of doing more than just ""pulling and turning."" This is assuming such a thing could be built of course—while there has been a fair amount of hype surrounding the idea in the media and so on in the last several years, I have no idea if anyone has gotten anywhere close to actually making one."
"If abstract labour is division of labour, what is concrete labour and why even bother with both terms or is that your conclusion here?"
"Thanks. I'm inclined to just leave arguments to the experts on this. But on face value, the freedom of the human being seems like an important aspect of Marx's argument. I think the difficulty then comes in conceptualising that freedom both in itself and in relation to the means/mode of production - but maybe that is the essential thing here seeing as it is the means of production, in the capitalist system, that robs humans of their freedom and so is the antithesis of human labour?"
"I think a good way to frame the ""human vs. horse"" discussion of value is to consider the food replicator technology in Star Trek. Under such conditions the value goes to zero. My point is that only people give value, because people are members of a group. Unless we can find ways to really communicate with animals, they will not be members of our group, and therefore not be able to produce value. Under capitalism, the food replicator would not be made available to people (consumers) and its products would fetch a profit even when sold for a penny a piece."
nice
What does he mean here by the term _abstract_ when he applies it to human labour?
"2 things - 
1. social division of labor isn't indicative by itself of the existence of abstract labor
2. when you're claiming that abstract labor existed in societies prior to capitalism, you are actually analyzing what Marx calls concrete labor [i.e. human labor in the abstract]. abstract labor is precisely NOT the species' capacity for creative labor in the abstract, in spite of their nominal similarity, but the specific form of the labor-commodity into which concrete labor is subsumed in a capitalist mode of production.

both are pretty fundamental errors, making your exhortations to read the source rather than relying on commentators pretty compelling. the conflation of abstract labor and historical concrete labor is what Marx repeatedly calls the error of bourgeois political economy, viz. not historicizing your own categories. Prior to capitalism it was impossible to conceive of ""abstract labor"" as a category [well, not impossible in some metaphysical sense, rather the historical development of the concept of abstract labor IS in a sense the development of capital, and so abstract labor logically can't precede it, even if we're speaking of fragmentary proto-capitalism]. For example he notes in vol. 1 that Aristotle could conceive of the category of use-value, but failed to do the same for exchange-value, for the reason that Greek society did not have generalized wage labor and commodity production, i.e. no system of abstract labor.

 It's true that the cat can't be put back into the bag in a sense [weltgeist thermodynamics!], but since abstract labor is at once the form of labor-compulsion under capitalism and the form on which capitalism as a conceptual totality is reliant, a communist project has to deal with it creatively [or destructively!] instead of accepting it as a fact of nature."
"Prof, how does one measure the value of software? Is it in the realm of services as an M-C-P-M' profit cycle, meaning no contribution to economic value?"
"Read Marx first. Since first watching this I have read a great deal more of the great man's works and I have this to thank in part for providing me with the impetus to do so. It's an excellent piece of advice. The more you read the richer & more compelling the tapestry becomes. There are tons of Marx reading groups out there to help, just do it!"
12:33 it's not just primitive it's still present. It's horrendous.
"I don't think Marx himself considered slave labour as contributing to surplus value. From the Grundrisse:
""In the slave relation, he belongs to the individual, particular owner, 
and is his labouring machine. As a totality of force-expenditure, as 
labour capacity, he is a thing [Sache] belonging to another, and hence 
does not relate as subject to his particular expenditure of force, nor 
to the act of living labour. In the serf relation he appears as a moment
 of property in land itself, is an appendage of the soil, exactly like 
draught-cattle. In the slave relation the worker is nothing but a living
 labour-machine, which therefore has a value for others, or rather is a 
value. The totality of the free worker’s labour capacity appears to him 
as his property, as one of his moments, over which he, as subject, 
exercises domination, and which he maintains by expending it. This to he
 developed later under wage labour"""
"I think this is a terribly arbitrary way to look at why only humans produce value. The reason for it I would rather argue is that humans subjectively only value their own work. In that nature does a lot of things but they only become interesting to humans once humans tailor that work for themselves. The sun for instance is itself most of all the work that humans exploit, from wind energy to horses to fuel it's all the sun in the end. But we humans don't count the sun because it's always there, as horses are always there, we value stuff that we can use. If capturing or breeding a horse costs 300h of human work, that's what the horse will naturally be valued by humans. Because indeed without those hours, the horse is nothing but a foreign useless animal.
The best analogy would be to show that on an opulent island, among hunter/gatherers, fruits in trees despite having required lots of work to grow, from the animals to the sun to the plant itself, are not valued by humans any more than the sand on the beach as those are indeed everywhere and require no human work."
"When I play the devils advocate : why does the abstraction of use value necessarily imply an abstraction of concrete work? Work consumes energy, things do not do that. So why take time as a source of value and not energy?


Another question: is the value of goods falling to zero with increasing automation?"
Marx in his Outline of a critique of political economy  extensively use the word subjective and objective.
"Marx and Engels Collected Works Volume 28; Lauren and Wishart 2010 edition. ""Marx also showed that “a singer who sells her song for her own account is an unproductive labourer. But the same singer commissioned by an entrepreneur to sing in order to make money for him is a productive labourer; for she produces capital” (see present edition, Vol. 34). “The same kind of labour,” Marx concludes, “may be productive or unproductive”.—231"""
Love Paul (and his squeaky chair...) who understands when it's important to go back to the source.
The audio in this video is pretty good. Good content as always by the way
"have you ever considered making a video on ""regulation school""?"
"16:10 My intelligent self sought it fit to dive in and to read Capital first, I however feel that it is easy enough to understand and follow along, though that may be because I have more free time to devote to reading it."
"""When you actually read Capital as opposed to commentators on Capital...""

Daaamn. What a roast."
"I think what a lot of people mean when they argue that abstract labor only exists under capitalism, is that only under capitalism does abstract labor come to be a real abstraction through exchange where it regulates production. In socialist society abstract labor is moreso a means of conscious allotment."
"I completely agree, I here plenty of Marxists recommending reading certain interpretations of Marx's work (usually in a shorter summary form) before reading Marx himself. Personally, I have decided to read Marx and Engels before I read the work of later Marxists so I can better spot wrong interpretations and misunderstandings of Marx & Engels. Capital is not the easiest series of books to read, but they are some of the most important and one cannot have a firm grasp of Marxist economics without reading them"
I dream to attend one of your lectures
"Dr. Cockshott, have you ever considered doing a Marxist critique of human capital theory?"
"So about the horses and animal labor:
I got into a discussion with a fellow communist and we disagreed on why work done by humans produces value and work done by machines and animals does not. My point was that humans use machine work and animal work and direct them, i.e. humans have to give additional information into the production process aside from just the components (materials, machines, animals,...). Animals can't do that on their own because we humans (as far as we know) are the only species able to use information in this specific way. And machines can't do that yet (perhaps some sentient robots in the future, but we are not yet there).
But I wasn't able to convince them that human labor has a special relation to information, that animals or machines on their own don't have. They said I was ""redefining"" what labor is, while I argued that only today we have the understanding about information (physics, computer science) that our knowledge of labor also is expanded and thus a more accurate definition of labor with these terms could be achieved.
My understanding of labor wasn't that good developed and I got a lot of this understanding that I described above from the early chapters of the ""Classical Econophysics"" book that you Dr. Cockshott have co-written. But my questions would be: Is my understanding correct? (I guess I should reread that book nevertheless because I'm not yet able to stand in an argumentation regarding these topics); And how you would argue in this case?"
"Most people who make these arguments have the USSR living rent-free in their head. The USSR had division of labour and abstract labour, so it's just another way for these people to say it's ""state-capitalist"" - same for the people who think slogans like ""abolish work"" or ""abolish schools"" is some form of going back to the radical ideas Marx meant originally.

Behind theoretical disagreements within Marxism are usually just political disagreements, dressed up as theoretical questions, usually inherited from the divisions of the Marxist movement in the 20th century. You don't do this, which is why you are a refreshing voice I think."
"I think I disagree that the reason that only human labor is abstract or produces value is because it can be put to more uses than horse labor or machine labor. (I'm not even sure if I agree that human labor can be put to more uses than horse labor or machine labor.) I think the reason is entirely social. Your explanation implies that slave labor produces value, but I don't think it does - isn't the price of maintaining the slave passed to the product just as the price of maintaining the horse? And your explanation implies that if horse labor could be put to as many uses as human labor (or if there were machines with human abilities), they would produce value, but again I don't think they would."
