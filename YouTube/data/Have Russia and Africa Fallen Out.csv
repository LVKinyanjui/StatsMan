"CORRECTION: As an eagle-eyed commenter has pointed out, the reason South Africa announced that it would be arresting Putin would be arrested if he visited the country was because the South African High Court ruled that to do otherwise would be a violation of South Africa's legal obligations as a signatory to the Rome Statute, in a case brought by the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party. (source here: https://www.wionews.com/world/south-african-government-ordered-to-arrest-vladimir-putin-618206 ). Contrary to what we implied in the video, the timing is merely coincidental. 

We're really sorry for this - it's a sloppy error that we shouldn't be making, and we hope you nonetheless enjoyed the video."
"africa could support the west or russia, what difference would it make?"
"a sham grain deal where most of the grain went to EU instead of Africa, Russia was right to exit the deal Russia can always use north-south corridor to export their grains to the eastern coast of Africa where the grain and fertilizer can then be distributed to the rest of Africa"
Anti Russia video 😅😅
"Russia has always held this dream of basically controlling Africa by controlling the food supply, but they're always seemingly surprised when Africans are having none of it."
6:50 Putin Got A Restraining Order
This channel is full of the West Propaganda. What a shitty analysis.
"Africa bought Russian weapons. They've just found out they are useless. Africa is a little annoyed they've wasted money . Africa had their food destroyed by Russia. How to make friends and influence people.  India bought Russian jets. They returned them as the engines didn't work.  Russia had contracts to supply ammo, they've kept it to use themselves."
How does that threaten food security 😅😅 70% of the grains going to Europe anyways and most eu countries didn't want the Ukrainian grains 😅😅 either way Ukraine grain's isn't free them countries pay for it and Russia has offered to replace it with its grain for free so ur video ain't relevant 😅
Wonder if africans will continue cheering for putler while they're starving..
"Its only North Africa countries that are under the mercy of Russian grain imports the rest of Africa will be fine, they have other alternatives."
"At 2:18 you speak of food prices going down from their dizzying post-war highs.

I wish we were post-war buddy... I wish."
"The smartest thing that should be on everyone's mind right now should be to invest in different streams of income that are not dependent on the government. Especially with the current economic crisis around the world. This is still a good time to invest in gold, silver, and digital currencies (BTC ETH...)."
Meanwhile African leaders are gathering today in Russia
Within 4 hours!
"If the West wanted to do anything good for Africa they had a time of 400 years to do it, so why is west so angry when India, China or Russia make their own deals with Africa. Africa is continent of fully suvereign countries so they are free to make their own decisions, even their own mistakes which will surely come, because they come with independent choices ... come down let Africa fully decide. China never comes to Africa saying , if you wanna trade with me you need to stop trading with USA... It is western desease to do these tricks"
"it is more likely that Africa will ditch the GANGE of FORMER/CURRENT COLLONISATORS UK and AngloSaxon Gang of 5, FRANCE, SPAIN, PORTUGAL"
Putin is a jerk.He don't care if Africans starve. Putin just wants to make money out of this .
"Bad timing propaganda, Africans leadera are in Russia today 27/72023 signing deals and lughing with putin🥂🍿🍷❤️"
Africa needs the grain so they don't let poo eopl we starve millions. Of course Russia causing those people there.
Fake news  Ukraine grain never ever  reach Africa 80%  Ukraine grain go to Europe  10 % Middle east  10% Asia  stop lying  Africa is forever supports   no matter wat even if they wrong  we  millions time supports Russia 💯  Putin  Russia help alot African  rebels  fighting  against  westerns  fascist savages uncivilized  devils colonial
"Food?
Your weak mindset of hunger gets in the way of Russia's ambitions and righteousness of claiming stuff. Bigoted western propagandists."
It's  very disappointing that African leaders refused to comdemn Putin
If the African  countries  back pputin they will  get nothing of putin now Africans can starve serves them right
I find it funny Africa hates the colonizers so much they supported the last standing colony in the world a.k.a. the Russian empire 😅
Not even the...
They offer nothing but increased unrest!
For China 🎉 ?
Turns out starving them isn’t a great plan and blowing up food
"When wishful thinking becomes ""news"" 😂"
"Believe it or not, the natives tend to become restless when you starve them. or look as if you are about to."
"I'm doing my part in reducing grain supply by eating popcorn while reading russian trolls ""whatabou"" crap in the comments😊 🍿"
Africa they doesn't need America is full of sanctions and dicteta they thought they still colonies Africa 😂😂😂and that's the reason Africa to choose Russia as true friend
1:46 you are lying west didn't lift sanctions on russia why you lie??
Channels like this are no different than CNN russia hve kuch influence in africa than before
Pootin has learned the feeling of getting dumped by all your black friends.
"Why would any African want their country to have closer ties with Russia? Ukraine and Russia were so close they referred to each other as brotherly nations, have a look how that turned out. (and no, it's nothing to do with NATO expansion, Russia has been invading Ukraine since 2014 while NATO was rejecting Ukraine's request to join)"
"It’ll be hard for Africa to turn on Russia, after all, many African countries have their media controlled by China, like South Africa for example, and China is obviously pro putin"
"""If something is free, you are the product"""
This has very little impact on the west. As we saw with gas last winter they have the cash to hoard everything if they want to. So the people getting hurt are always the global south.
"As a logician I've always wondered what it's like in someone else's brain. How do they think, feel, and react to the world around them. As long as you choose a broad selection of informative educational content, Youtube allows you a small window into the minds of certain groups like lawyers, doctors, marketers, scientists, and musicians. I know this tangent has nothing to do with the content of the video but as I watched your skillshare plug I began thinking about the words you chose and how they differ from say Legal Eagle, the lawyer youtuber I enjoy watching."
Africa's support for Putin's War of Colonization of Ukraine is good evidence that the Slave Trade & Colonialism were just projects & no more complaints!
"You spelled Odesa wrongly, there are only one “s” in the name"
"Of course, when you say so 😁😁"
"As someone who lives far further South on the globe of most of the ""Global South""  yet is apparently part of the ""Global North"" I would like to once again say that it's a stupid term and should be scrapped."
typical africans succumbing to their colonial masters once again
Russia could do grain transfers via the Caspian and then to the Persian Gulf.
"What all the experts fail to understand about ""Western"" conflicts is that the rest of the developing world is tired of all the hipocrasy. For example South Africa doesnt support Russia we are just minding our business being non-aligned in a conflict we cannot impact in anyway - Immed the ""West"" is shocked because we dont automatically support them or support Ukraine being turned into an abbatoir for young people on both sides NOT the politicians playing geopolitical games. Both sides are equally responsible because there was UN backed agreement - Minsk agreement which Ukraine continually ignored by bombarding the people in Donetsk egged on by the ""West"". NATO's own experts warned that expanding the alliance would lead to a conflict with Russia but they were ignored by the politicians now the poor Ukrainians will suffer the consequences for generations to come for being Nato's proxy. I genuinely hope that a peaceful resolution can be found."
"I just find it hilarious that Putin's proposed alternative to the Black Sea deal was basically, ""Hey Qatar, you wanna pay me for the privilege of doing me a favor?"""
"Come on, this headline is way too clickbaity and overgeneralizing 🙄 as if africa is a country or Africans all think alike. It’s almost condescending to imply that Africans are just one collective blob that have same foreign policy"
Russia is running out of help and such...
"Of course, when you say so 😁😁"
"everything you say i know for sure it’s the opposite, did you remember erdogan videos, you was saying he’s gonna lose look what happened now. and how many videos you did saying that russia is losing or lost 🤣🤣🤣 you propaganda is so dumb"
"Africa must ditch Putin & Russia.
Putin will lure Africans into a war they can ill afford.
Russia has never invested in  South Africa.
Putin will do anything and everything to cling onto power.
If Africa is not careful they will be Putin's next target.
South African leaders don't even care for their own farmers or people and run the country into the ground but they want to tell other countries how to conduct their affairs! 😂"
Nah they love dictators.
ahgrica in fact ditch usa and europe...centuries of humiliation exploitation and corruption must come to an end..
"Afric must ditch Russia,the west and china,they must strengthen relationships among african states,its hard for africans to get a visa to london even harder to travel to another African state,cant be making alliances outside tge continent when there arent alliances on the continent.none of countries outside tge continent gives a shit about africa and it people,they are here for our platinum.if i was the president of Africa id tell Suella to keep her wet island as long as he moves brititish mining companies off our continent"
"Africa’s ambivalence towards the war makes complete sense to me; they see this as Europe’s problem. Rightly so. 

Putin choosing to make this *their* problem - now suddenly the arithmetic is changing isn’t it lol."
"I would say the phrase get Africa back on side is very counter productive, a better way of phrasing it getting Africa away from Ukraine, as stated in this video Africa is mostly unified in their ambilivance towards the conflict on moral bases."
Its darkest before dawn...
"👨‍🦲🇷🇺🌍 President Vladimir Putin's statement at the plenary session of the Russia-Africa Forum:

 ➡️Russia plans to open branches of its leading universities in African countries, as well as to create schools in Africa with the study of the Russian language

➡️Russia has already exported 10 million tons of grain to Africa in the first 6 months of the year

➡️In the coming months, Russia will supply African countries with 25-50 thousand tons of grain for free and provide free delivery

➡️Russia hopes to launch an industrial zone near the Suez Canal in Egypt in the near future

➡️The Russian Federation is ready to develop the financial infrastructure of Africa, including connecting them to the Russian payment system

➡️The potential of Africa is obvious to everyone, the growth of the GDP of the countries of the continent exceeds the world average.

➡️Russia has always paid and will continue to pay special attention to the supply of wheat, barley, corn and other grain crops to African friends

➡️The President came up with the idea of   creating a common information space between Russia and Africa, where objective information will be broadcast.

🔴 @DDGeopolitics"
"Putin just want to sell his grain At a higher price 
Which will backfire on him? Cause he is still not winning the war"
"ffin idiots. just tell him to yes, come to the meeting and then put a chain on him, come on!"
"Getting sick of this narrative that we Africans are very dependent on Russo-Ukranian grain. Egypt & other desert countries sure, but the vast majority of the continent can manage just fine without those two countries."
"Sorry. But this geographic illiteracy. Africa is not a country. Like Asia it is a CONTINENT. It has 54 countries. Each looking after its OWN interest. As such there’s no such thing as a common African policy on Russia, Putin, China, the West or anything."
"This piece is too shallow. Have you read the official positions of individual African countries with regards to their relationship with Russia?? Online news blogs are not official government communication channels and are not government policies.

         African countries will still largely abstain or at least vote for Russia at the UN because they don't trust the West. Russia has strong ties to Africa since the '40s and '50s during the struggle for independence and self rule in Africa.  And yes, anyone with a brain knows that NATO is the one provoking Russia through expansion to the East. If you cannot have Russian missiles in Cuba (a free and sovereign nation), then common sense dictates that you cannot have NATO missiles in Ukraine, also a free and sovereign state."
"I hope African countries don't trust Putin's promises, because Putin has broken all the agreements he made so far, they have no reason to believe that Putin will keep the agreements he made with them."
"As mentioned in other comments, South Africa didn’t back down because of Russia pulling out of the grain agreement, the rulling party, the African National Congress (ANC) was forced by the South Africa courts, following a legal application by the main opposition, the Democatic Alliance (DA), to enforce the law introduced in the wake of the Omar al-Bashir mess back in 2015, that says we MUST honour ICC arrest warrants.

The ANC is big on ""loyalty to countries who aided them during the Struggle (against Apartheid)."" One of their biggest allies in the Struggle was the Soviet Union (a country which no longer exists), due to their shared communist ideals. Unfortunately, this hasn't deterred the aforementioned loyalty to the Russian Federation, despise the RU no longer being a communist country.

So, as you can see, there is a lot of context missing from this video with regards to South Africa. You may, perhaps, want to consider doing a video on the whole Russia-South Africa debacle, which is causing considerable consternation among South Africans who want South Africa to ""pick a side"" (ideally one that isn't Russia).

One question I often ask is how the ANC would react if the USA or UK were to invade South Africa to reinstall the apartheid regime. After all, the UK and USA did quietly back the Apartheid government back in the day because they saw South Africa as a last line of defence against Africa falling to communism. So, why is the ANC backing Russia in this war to, essentially, do the very same thing (i.e. to reinstall a previous regime that the people of Ukraine don't want)?"
Stop saying Africa its only 2 percent going there
"Most of Africa's wheat comes from Russia (Russia is the largest exporter of wheat in world after all).

So, they can only get so angry at Russia. In fact, Russian wheat being difficult to export should mean more worry for African countries.

You yourself published a list from UNCTAD, that showed how much African countries import Russian wheat (especially South Africa got half their wheat from Russia and almost none from Ukraine).

And the ultimate question would then be (based on the thumbnail ""Africa ditch Putin?""), ditch Russia for who? The Western governments? After they treated them so badly when they landed in places like Poland recently for peace talks or events where they held up the security? -> https://youtu.be/O-4Dts32MCQ  or evens like these -> https://youtu.be/ldBKmPsST6A and https://youtu.be/Up_V7VCsQII ) 

Maybe your next video should be: ""Have the EU and Africa Fallen Out? I don't recall you covering those stories.

After the history overall between most Western governments and Africa? I mean, take some time to read up on Africa's history with Western countries and at the same time the Soviet Union (and to that extend Russia and Moscow's history with Africa).

Also, some of the points made in your piece, like around 6:42 lacks a lot of context, but I see in the comment section people are pointing them out. Can fool some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all of the time."
"The term ""Global South"" is just wrong for so many reasons."
"Global South is probably the worst geopolitical term... Why isn't developed, developing and under- developed isn't used anymore. Hell even first world, second world and third world terminology sounds more coherent... Before you judge me this is coming from some from a third world country... Global South just sounds dumb."
Stupid all Africa is with Russia
"You will be surprised how much support Russia carries in some African states even some that are pro west like Kenya for example recieved free fertilizer from Russia which was direly needed, some states have ties with Russia due to the arms sales , provision of security like mali, CAR,, and other countries have a very good diplomatic relationship with russia like Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Uganda ,south Africa etc.... Also not all countries in Africa need food from Ukraine or Russia....You need to look at each individual state as separate coz each have their own relationship with the Russians not just food..."
I was thinking Africa was being signed up by China and thus dropping Russian influence
"Here's the reality of the situation, the ""global south"" is irrelevant. Doesn't matter what side they're on."
Why not😂😂 THROW POOTIN OVER BOARD POOTIN BOTS N POOTIN ARE SALTY😂😂😂 THE HAGUE IS COMING FOR YOU POOTIN😂😂😂AND HIS POLE WORKING BOTS
Do a video on Biafra.
Timing bro. This video is soooo out of sync with reality but what else can we expect from a juvenile South African (I'm South African by the way)
these 2 deserve each other. let these african 'refugees' go to russia
"With Respect To Sir Mr President Putin Russia Country, - This Have Weird , Careful Sir, - God Bless You, Thanks All, ..... Cheerio.*****."
Title is stupid. 50+ countries will not fall out with one country all at once
"Don't you get it ....
Demographic collapse economic collapse the end of the Russian gass industry as of last year the end of its oil industry within the next 5 years 😅
Its over there is NO future for Russia its the end for them 
And let's be clear NO 1 will be sorry"
"Ok the video is clearly made to benefit one party over another.

First of all, the video over exagerates the importance of Ukrainian grain and saying that Africa relies on Ukrainian grain on one hand while also underminding the importance of Russian grain exports on the other hand and making feel that they aren't needed in the South, which it isn't really true. I am not saying that Ukrainian grain exports aren't important but making feel that Africa gets its grain excludingly, if not only, from Ukraine is wrong.

Second, the video states that Russia closed and re-opened the grain trade in the Black Sea, which is not quite true. Well it is true that Russia blockaded Ukrainian ports and sea coasts, the video clearly forgets or lacks to mention that it was actually Turkey that closed the Bosphorus and stopped all trades via the Black Sea, including grain trade from both Ukraine and Russia.

Third, Russia is painted as the one to end the deal, not in that video only but in others as well, while the real scenario is that Russia did its part of the deal by allowing Ukraine to export its grain via the Black Sea while the other members of the deal; UN, Ukraine and especially Turkey; didn't respect their part of the deal. By allowing Azov fighters to return to Ukraine, keep sanctions on Russian agriculture products and other things."
Neat
"Due to conditioning by the mainstream media which has been used as a tool of disinformation,  there is a common misconception by our brothers in the west.  Citizens in the west have developed an idea that here in Africa we survive on donations, It might be of interest to note that African states have paid for any grains that have come through from Ukraine. Africa will do just fine, food inflation effect is being felt by humanity equally USA is giving record amounts in food stamps to its citizen and having record numbers of takers  in food donation centers, Uk is engaging even supermarkets to understand what to do with the rising cost of food, Africa is engaging Russia for direct Purchase of grains in future.  In deteriorating Russia-west relationship, Africa and global south will have preference access to Russian grain and the west will suffer in long run. By putting an African Face to it, the west is securing its own future.  About South Africa cancelling attendance by Puttin due to Ukrain grain deal, this is far fetched and untrue. In a world where western Mainstream media is captured by state operators, the population that rely on such media for information will continue to be take fake news as real stories."
He steals little children from Ukraine and now takes food from the World's children. Wow!
"Why do people act like those grains are going to ""Africa"" the majority of those grains goes to china and Europe. The biggest importers of grain in Africa are north african countries, somalia and Eritrea (based on food aid) and Nigeria."
Africa sees Russia as a friend & are rushing to join BRICS and escape the Yankee threat of economic sanctions forever.
The united states was forced by china and russia to send ukraine unmaintained equipment saying that the war has been enough humiliation. The US backed of so russia walked back on it's promises and sold out africa. That's the real story never to be confirmed.
"Russian Peoples are tell only lies. So, They summon war by concealing peace."
Russia and China have to be the most dissapointing empires of human history. These guys are completely incapable of making strategic power moves. Absolutely pathetic😂😂😂
The most surprising thing about all this is how Libya and Iraq are considered “upper middle income”. Honestly good on them
Geez. You posted this video the day when almost 17 African head of state and 49 African countries are participating in Russia Africa summit happening in St Petersburg... The cope is strong in this video
"TLDR constantly spouts deep sate propaganda. Pity these kids are so naïve - bright eyed, bushy tailed, enthusiastic, dummies."
Thought Putin said western sanctions wasn't affecting Russia. Proves how putin lie all the time
The global south has Australia and New Zealand in it who have not been ambivalent about the invasion of Ukraine.  Australia has donated more military aid than most European NATO countries.
Half information
"More clickbait. I am telling you , my disappointment with this once more serious channel grows."
He is now starving them out and has threatened them with war so yes they should have the sense to can that stupid brics thing and cut off russia as they should have at the start.. they should also run wagnar out of russia as they are destabilising african regions on purpose.
Hair looks good on you 😊 suits u. 😂 youre my fav presenter ... great voice for podcast type broadcast. Keep it up👍🏻
"As a 27th generation South African citizen, the short answer to your question is no."
"Africa is out for Africa. Makes sense, but should take their opinion on global politics less seriously"
The question which remained unadressed is what russia had to offer african nations in the first place. Weapons? Mercenaries? Exploiters? Vodka?
"Russia is destroying Ukrainian grain so that it no longer a possible supplier. That way it can blackmail, strongarm and sway African countries with Russian grain. Of course with some arms as a sidedeal to keep the population under control."
Expecting loads of African countries to be hugely concerned by a war in Europe is insane. There's several ongoing wars in Africa right now. Yet its clear some people expect the world to be shocked and outraged because white people are losing their lives...
Poor people usually spend their money and invest what's left that's the philosophy of the poor. Rich people invest their money and spend what's left and here is the startling answer. It really doesn't matter what the amount is what is most important is not the amount what's really important is the philosophy
48th comment 😎😎
"Africans are finally realising Ukrainian grain is stopping them from starving to death. I hope that after the war, the Ukrainian government will remember that many of those countries were fully supporting russia during the invasion, and charges them the highest possible price ever for grain."
"It's over for Russia now, they have lost Equatorial Guinea this will shatter their morale. They  will retreat from Donbass. Crimea will be Ukrainian. Uganda will legalize being gay. China will collapse. Everybody will accept the Westminster system."
Africa is a continent. That man is the president of South Africa. Get your shit together.
"so many african countries are just dogmatically anti western, they are blind to russian/chinese shenanigans, this will now bite them in the a*s, hard to feel bad about it..."
"Every day more and more countries come to the conclusion that Russia has been run by gangsters for the past 2 decades and they're never happier than when they're using extortion tactics. Except on China and India. Everyone else, though, is fair game."
Global south realising Russia isn’t a reliable partner who uses food as a weapon: 😮
"All the Ukr grain goes to Europe not Africa. True it does help keep world commodity prices a bit lower, the only advantage to Africans. Russias grain & fertiliser are not sanctioned but other barriers like Swift block transactions. In the deal there were things Europe agreed to that they still have not honoured - connecting Russias Agri Bank to Swift for example. It's only the flick of a switch to do that. Euro madness."
Africa is not a country... you can't point out a few countries to try and represent an entire continent of 54 countries.....
"The spider web of global grain market and politics well explained, great job"
Cheers guys keep them coming.
"Meanwhile North African still cheer for Putin as they starve, Don't seek out Logic where non exist"
"they are pissed russia is attacking grain because they  have food problems and they dont understand what putler is doing, only useless destruction which makes no sense for the world taking the entire world hostage because of his useless war"
Is Putin the dumbest dictator alive? Wasting your expensive missiles to attack grain and anger your only allies 😂
Unless you are Niger's coup leaders.
"6:45 - SA President Ramaphosa’s position on this is one of political expediency, claiming he can’t arrest Putin as it would be an “act of war”. However, his ANC Party has always stuck to SA’s legal commitment to the ICC so there’s no contradiction here."
"6:41  the bit about South Africa is lacking so much information that it could be considered false.

The main opposition party (DA) launched the application to clarify the government's obligations to execute a warrant of arrest for Putin as a signatory to the Rome Statute and won.

The leading party on the other hand wanted to find a legal way to allow Putin into the country.

Edit: in my economics class the DA was said to share the same economic values as the west. Take thst how you will."
Great job guys.
"Maybe?... define what you mean by Africa ditching Russia... what's the threshold here? Is it 30 out of the 54 or so very large to very small to as populated as Brazil and The US  and as small as Monaco, how do we define ""ditching"" when we say ""Africa"" the second biggest contiant on the planet."
I understood that China is the number one buyer of Ukrainian grain.
"Russia has found new friends in Africa, opening Embassies in every country.  The African people chant ""Russia is fighting the colonial imperialists, long live Russia.""  Russia will give grain to those nations too poor to cope, others are getting a cheap deal. Africa sees Russia as a friend & are rushing to join BRICS and escape the Yankee threat of economic sanctions forever."
The exact destination of the grain is not as relevant as the 10% jump in expected price since the Odessa bombard started …
"This is nonsense really. The UN has already reported that only 3% of the grain went to poorer nations. The rest went to middle and higher income countries. So Putin did speak the truth. Now the report also says that the deal also dampened prices worldwide, so poor nations could afford it. 

That may well be but nearly 800 million people went hungry last year. So clearly the deal failed or did not live up to expectations. Most notably when the Netherlands bought 2 million tons of wheat and maize to feed their pigs, geez, that was harsh!"
I find it vaguely amusing that you guys only gave Somalia the land it actually owns
Russia shooting itself in the foot is nothing new honestly at this point.
"The west needs to start being just as ambivalent to the needs of Africa. No exploitation. Just leave them to there own. If we needed help, they wouldn’t offer it. They’d laugh in our faces. We need to look at their suffering and do the same. Let them sort themselves out. We are in this alone. Just accept it."
i think NO bec africa is split into china and russias influence and africa is anti west now
"Once again, Poutine (I refuse to refer to him as anything else) makes a rather questionable decision that weakens Russia’s international standing in exchange for an ever decreasing likelihood of winning this war…"
An impending famine concentrates the mind wonderfully
"Does the fallout happen that quickly? Many Africans, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, have been cheering Russia and Russian invasion since day 1. They are blaming the West for grain crisis, even when it was Russia who bombed it. If they love Russia that much, they should settle in Russia."
"No, I don't think, cuz many european countries will suffer from this issue"
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦💯🤘
"Hello from Australia.

Yes I paid 5 dollars to say this.

Edit: Why, because supporting independent journalism or something like that"
"Hmmmm… I can’t see how coke sniffing, money grabbing Zelenskyy is any better. It’s time to negotiate a settlement"
Who would have guessed than simping for the nation that tries to cut off your food supply Isn't a good idea
Maybe
Shouldn’t have pulled out of the grain deal.
