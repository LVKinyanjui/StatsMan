"When the reality that CBDC is a tyrant's wet dream, the social credit score becomes a reality, and the 1984-style police and surveillance state stirs public unrest, the great reset will become less predictable. I hope."
"Collapsing = 1% just because I don't want to write 0%
Recovery in a year or 2 = 99%  Judging by the Wall Street reaction to the stimulus by the Chinese govt, yea, 99%.  
Japan style stagnation = 1%  This will happen if the intentional real estate bubble popping goes wrong.  
Slower growth from now on = 50% If the real estate bubble popping cannot be managed, this will happen.  China will be licking this wound for a while.

No clickbait. No malicious headlines. Just informative and neutral information. This channel is a game changer.
"Sure it is highly likely that China can manipulate itself out of the real estate crisis, its crumbling infrastructure expenditures, and even its mass retirement. But this and other such videos omit the fact that China is the world's biggest importer of food and energy in a fragile global trade network that depends heavily on rapidly fading US naval security. The demographic collapse, the imminent end of cheap Russian energy imports, fertilizer, the increase cost of Chinese labor (16x in 20 yrs), the increase in manufacturing competition...those factors are virtually ignored here."
"Because of the concentration of power directly under President Xi and his strong ideology, I am concerned we will get a situation similar to Turkey."
"Yep , cannot collapse something that is already collapsed."
Please correct the map
"While you have some valid points, it doesn't seem you are answering the question you set out directly. This video does not answer why China would not collapse, but why China would not collapse THE WAY the US did. 

The independent currency point is also untenable, as China's economy solely base on artificially inflating the housing market and manipulates its currency to maintain an export advantage. The latter is done by excessively buying the USD, which means China either collapses WITH the US if a global recession is to come, or gives up its own currency advantage which inevitably leads to stagnation or even recession."
You were right after all
You do realize that China controls the financial sector? They are corrupt and falsify their banking ledgers?  They just admitted they falsified their national census by over 100 MILLION?  China steals our intellectual property and make sub/ par knock offs‚Ä¶ are you really going to bat for China?  Best of luck to you
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax-shaaring_reform_of_in_in_1994
You ignore the relationship between China's real estate and local government finance and debt.
Chinese local governments monopolize land, rely on hunger marketing, squeeze the people's wealth to obtain fiscal revenue, and repeat investment in in construction and road construction for GDP numbers, even borrowing debt to build.
If China's real estate bubble collapses, the fiscal revenue of local governments will collapse, medical insurance and pensions bankruptcy, public officials will be unemployed, the money of the local bank will be stolen by the government, because the shareholders are the local government.
If the central government chooses to rescue, it will cause serious serious serious Inflation.
the status quo is that the Chinese government does not want the real estate bubble to continue to become larger, nor does it want it to be burst."
I'm digging this channel thanks
"Over the last 9 months things have changed a bit.  No, no collapse in months.  With the present decline in the Chinese Economy social cohesion is starting to fray.  I have seen that the stress of the Housing debacle (not just the bubble, but the uncompleted houses and the pay-everything upfront model) along with rising unemployment and closing factories is making the public restless.  Recently there was a film from China of people attaching the local thugs that ""police"" the small-time entrepreneurs in the street stalls.  They actually surrounded them, beat on them and the ""real"" police had to rescue the thugs.  This is not the beginning of revolution but it is showing that the anger of the Chinese people against the CCP can only be contained for so long."
I think China will follow what happened/occurring with Japan. The country will still have a decent money but it won't grow strongly and can't go against the USA
"If China invades Taiwan and destabilizes shipping in the South China Sea, will that affect its export capacities?"
"CCP regime has forced all people savings into  the wasting asset of vacant real estate.  This will not end well.  The Keynsian socialist idea that a government can produce anything and dump it into the ocean is sustainable is pure economic idiocy.  Production is NOT the key. Wealth building IS, and you don't build individual or national wealth by spending resources to create things of no value."
"FYI the odds of rolling 2x6, 2x3, or 2x4 are exactly the same."
$ reserves is essentially a stock.  It eventually gets depleted. Capital controls again only work for so long.  A complete collapse doesn't have to happen suddenly but stretching it out over a longer period still ends up at the same destination.
"It is going to collapse. The entire civilized world is decoupling from them. Once all the manufacturing is pulled from China and they west sanctions them out of existence, their economy will collapse. China does not actually manufacture all these things they are so proud of like the iphone or their new commercial jet the comac919. For both of those, 80% of parts are manufactured western countries, shipped to China and they just assemble it. China just assembles items with their slave labor. They are very low value add / low end manufacturing. They can't manufacture anything that requires precision manufacturing. It's not just microchips. It's all high end components, software and machinery they need to manufacture everything. Once the wester companies are out, the will cut China off from all the parts they need. Then they can steal all the IP that they want, but they will never be able to make their shitty Chinese copies because they won't be able to get their hands on the parts needed. In 2-3 years, they will be sanctioned out of existence."

...this is the slowest imminent collapse I have ever seen...
"Nobody knows what‚Äôs coming, not even you."
China will collapse when it start an attack on Taiwan and India. China economy have started collapsing with outflow of its capital by local and foreigners. China is shoring up its economy by printing RMB but it‚Äôs not working when it‚Äôs not increasing its foreign reserve by increasing US dollars. Heir hoarding of gold do not help in a world depression. The only solution for China and the works is to replace current leadership with his cronies who are stupid and lacking the skill to manage a large economy.
"Any new thoughts?
Lots falling apart now."
Long term billions will boucott Chinese products and like Japan it will shrink for decades I view this as collapsing.
Why did you not discuss the credibility of their financial statements? How can they bail out all their all unprofitable assets? No one will buy their bonds or VIE cayman Island shell companies any more
"Update. Chinese are now losing their bank deposits.
Losing foreign investments and loans to developing countries are in default.
 China made its money on exporting. Good luck exporting to Africa. Then there's the Soulth China...... Sea"
I highly suggest those who are interested in China economics to visit China Update ( https://www.youtube.com/@ChinaUpdate )
"Most of the bank money (thin air money) have been stolen/laundered out of China by CCP officials with their friends and family members.  Currently, rich people in China are paying an exchange rate premium of 15% to 30% to get their money out of China to skirt the $50K usd per person per year threshold limit .
Michael Pettis also said there is no crash. He also said the Chinees government cannot spend their way out of this crisis by investing in infrastructure again because for every ""one"" Yuan of GDP growth, they incurred 2.5 to 12.5 Yuan of debt throughout the past decade.  A recent report by the Bank for International Settlement estimated that the Chinese government incurred $37 Trillion usd in debt from June 2012 to June 2022."
"China's economy did not ""literally"" run out of steam. 
Pet peeve is how ""literally"" is abused, misused, and misunderstood. 
China's economy was not running on steam. 
So, it could not ""literally"" run out of steam. 
Literally means actually.  
AND it is used as the opposite of ""metaphorically"".  
Please, if you want to sound smart -- know the words you use."
"1. China has the largest savings in the world, Chinese people like to save money.
2. The Chinese government can control all bank capital, loans and stop loans in any crisis will not be transmitted to other industries.
3. China has almost no foreign debt denominated in US dollars. All domestic loans are denominated in RMB. The Chinese government has $3 trillion in assets.
4. The Chinese people have special trust in the government
5. China is still the fastest growing country in the world.
6. Provides the country's development to drain domestic debt

"I think the main issue at work here is that the Putin-Trump cult's hatemongering against China is picking up speed over the past years

So a lot of people who are high on Fox News would LIKE China to collapse.

But economy is not among the problems China has. It's still the world's workshop, it still has huge capital controls that force people into real estate development. All these things such as strict covid restrictions that hamper export, are choices by the regime. As we've seen with the covid measures, these can be changed.

As long as you can abolish such measures and basically you can choose what problems you have, you don't have real problems. Real problems are the ones you can't choose, but come to you."

Thank you for making videos like these! Came from The Plain Bagel since he recommended your channel.
part of this thesis is that the 3 red lines happened soon enough and that other sectors aren't under big problems
Brought to you by the CCP .
I agree that clickbait titles are just that clickbait. China's economy faces tons of issues and the CCP cannot continue spending trillions to bailout industries like housing but they will. They will continue wasting billions to keep the GDP growing but it cannot continue indefinetly. Short term and long term issues will slowly kill China's economy and growth while the CCP becomes more aggressive on the international stage. One issue that will 100% change China's economy for the worse is demographics or China's rapidy aging population.
"Stop defending china you communist 
You can‚Äôt make an economy full of elderly people sane with japan full of elderly an now they are close to a civil war an one more thing, china dont have enough soldiers why cause they have mire elderly an young peopleüòä"
I have to admit you do know something about China
China is not going to collapse for now. People confuse their desire for a better world with reality
"I‚Äôd say it depends on the response of their people, which you can‚Äôt predict. If they stopped working at places that make our phones and medications‚Ä¶yeah, then you can talk about collapse. Eventually, money and labor are the same thing."
Good bullish analysis. What do you think of Jim Rickard's extreme bearish scenario?
"The whole world is run on massive money printing credit especially in the last 2-3 years. 
The whole world is going into a slow recession it seems. A good lesson for everyone."
Good call.
"China is experiencing their economic woes because of their business and investment practices. One cannot be communist AND capitalist simultaneously folks.

Plus Chinese culture f's up their investments; real estate is a prime example.
Chinese buy properties thinking they will maintain value FOREVER but they'll let their property crumble DEVALUING their ""investment property"". Inside China this isn't an issue for Chinese have a warped sense of property investment. BUT in foreign markets NOT SO MUCH.

Everywhere else on the planet properties need to be maintained to keep their value. In the United States many Chinese owned properties have become CONDEMNED and are being seized by the US government under imminent domain so the properties can be demolished and land used responsibly.

What is terrible is Chinese portfolios don't reflect the dilapidated state of their ""investment properties"". They only care if you own it or not. BUT that is NOT how real estate works. They're LYING on their financials."
"China is great at making things, especially money. Chinese currency will soon be almost worthless, so any other countries that trade with China should be aware of the value of Chinese money. China's economy won't  crumble, just the countries that trade with China, their economies will crumble, because of China's worthless currency"
You're wrong!China is decling!!!!!Chinese even couldn't eat enough food!!!!!
"Wow!  You‚Äôre so off base it‚Äôs scary.  You cling to propaganda fantasies to try and convince watchers of your position.  While none of us has a crystal ball, I have to say, and time will tell, you‚Äôre not even close.  I have decades of Wall Street banking experience, I lived in China for over a decade and I‚Äôm very knowledgeable of how the CCP lies about their economy.  Really about everything.  The Chinese economy is in free fall. Anyone with a basic knowledge of economics about China knows it‚Äôs tanking.  In 2009 I told many people in China their real estate industry was on a track of disaster. I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball. I just read the signs.  It was all there. The CCP kept the disaster hidden like they do all bad news until they couldn‚Äôt.  Let me ask you one question.  How much is the CCP paying you to put out this nonsense?  I ask because they do it all the time.  Best of luck my friend."

"It may be not the greatest colapse and a soon one due to construction & banking issues, but please notice China is fastest aging country  with warped sex balance, is importer of both energy and food, and is not able to get over US chips ban by itself. All those are serious issues and 0 CV19 policy is not helping as well..."
"Your argument hinges on the CCP doing the right thing and bailing out the banks instead of making an example out of them and high amounts of international trade. The CCP has rarely turned down an opportunity to make an example out of organizations that make them look weak. Also with the US sanctioning China, and many large tech manufacturing companies moving away from China, I dont believe this is exactly probable either. It is nice to hear some counter arguments to the doom, gloom, and clickbait. But I still side with the argument  that: the greed of the old men running the CCP, outweighs saving their people and country."
"Basically China is too big to fall and US was too stupid, so fell.
Also Sri Lanka barely survived a huge fall"
Very good analysis... Completely agree... Though medium to long term China's adveserial relationship with US and rest of the world is going to be the real challenge..
how china is collapsing.  when half of the world is looking china for rescue?
only British you tuber are saying china is collapsing.
"china is not going to collapse, they are going to go back into hiding themselves from the world"
"China is a planned economy, that is why the real estate bubble got so big. Non performing loans were the order of the day. How many infrastructure projects do you need to have with a population of one billion plus."
"No, it‚Äôs being collapsing in slow mo for 30 years üòÇ"
"Part I don't understand is why the 3rd and last alternative (with highest probability) is given as stagnation. What about the possibility of continued sustained growth? The author seems fully aware that there are major differences between China and its institution and the comparisons it made, is it really that hard to imagine a scenario where China manages to sustain fairly strong growth for say 50 years. Seems like this guy has far to much focus on financial metrics and not nearly enough on industrial development metrics, and for long term analisis isn't the later far more important?"
"So basically, what this guy is saying is ‚ÄúChina is not going to crumble like Sri Lanka, but it‚Äôs going down the drain anyway and rapidly‚Äù. Listen to the problems listed by this guy: capital fleeing in droves. Having to rescue banks and real state sector for billions and billions of dollars if not trillions. Persistence of Covid infection. Not listed: dramatic slow down of the economy. Unemployment rising. Slowing down of the tech sector. Having to increase military expending due to US‚Äôs military aggression. Public and private debt reaching the point of no return. In short, China is doomed. China has entered a long period of moderate or no growth. The easy economic defeat of China at the hands of the genocidal West is equivalent to the quick military defeat of Russia by genocidal NATO in Ukraine. Both events together point to the fact  that as Imperialism and Capitalism have entered an intense stage of decomposing and rotting with no end, there is no alternative right now to the world other than going down the sewers with the US, Britain and Europe."
"While the demise of China is greatly exaggerated it does have unique problems that will create instability.  It is not natural resources rich, has food shortages potential and population is shrinking at a higher rate than expected. Yes the world needs China over the short term but in 10 years China‚Äôs shortcomings will be significantly magnified."
Why do you tell the truth? LOL
"Quick question doctor. What's the inflation rate in China?

Being one step above literally illiterate new media goons isn't a high bar. Also you do a good job trying to seem objective but I sense covert anti China biases. Which isn't surprising for anyone with an economics degree as a big % of that field if not more could be described as basically a religious cult."
What's funny is this video is becoming more and more ironic
"China will collapse in a Chinese style collapse. That's all anyone needs to know or care about. That's what will happen. What form that it takes does not matter. The only way China will not have problems going forward is if society's morons continue to put their money in China and continue to allow the theft of their intellectual capital, while at the same time ignoring the fact that the CCP is an evil criminal regime. But hey, who can blame the CCP for its behavior, or for that matter, the behavior of the criminal politicians in the United States and across the world, for fleecing the sheople and shaping them into economic slaves. That's what criminals do and the sheople are born to be fleeced and then made into lamb chops. The criminal politicians are just volunteering to do the fleecing. And to be sure, Moa was also a moron as power does not flow from the barrel of a gun, but from the pictures in a TV set or images on social media. Media images are far more powerful than guns. Unfortunately such ideas do not seem to be understood by the morons on the political right."
"Interesting. At 7:05 the video says China is a manufacturing superpower making almost 20% of the world's manufactured goods. Interestingly, China has a little under 20% of the world's population. So it is manufacturing a little over its share. But not very much over."
"They may not collapse, but very sick I'm sure they will be.
China's economy depend on external finance a lot more than people think. Once trust is gone, it will be nighty night from then on. And it is fading rapidly."
"I disagree with your claim that the world needs Chinese products. While it's true that China touches a lot of products, they do so in a long globalized supply chain and the part of the value that China adds to these products is low value; think materials processing, assembly, and low end chips for things talking toasters -- not the high-value stuff. No joke, they didn't even figure out how to make high-end ballpoint pens fully in their own country until a few years ago."
"Exactly Joeri, there are too many click-bait title on youtube with people that pretend to know what they are talking about. You have credibility, as an academic and published scholar.  Thanks, and keep going. - Barry"
Good analysis. Thank you.
Still waiting for China's economy to collapse as the YouTube sophists predicted.
Finally some relative sanity.
"The problem is that China‚Äòs lack of transparency sparks such extreme rumors. The whole x or y will collapse videos or articles are usually just clickbait. Still I would like to hear your opinion on some of the worrying fundamentals:
- China‚Äòs GDP is likely overstated. At least many serious academic papers claim that. 
- China‚Äòs productivity is now flat for the last 10-15 years
- total debt levels are even worse than anything in the west
- it is more dependent on the real estate sector than anything in the west pre-2008
- the economy is now dominated by state owned companies. How will they achieve long-term efficiency. 
- even youth unemployment is worse than anything in the west. 

I don‚Äôt think they are heading for collapse but how can they continue? It‚Äôs probably a long grinding decline instead of a continuous rise for China."
"Westerners sanctions and then try to predict ""collapse"" for over a decade. Shows how Westerners dont understand China"
"Even if the CCP manages to pull enough levers to keep the Chinese economy from outright collapsing in rapid fashion, they're 100% screwed in the long run regardless.  The demographic time bomb resulting from the one child policy is going to cause them to stagnate the same way Japan did, only worse, due to all the other confounding factors like the insane levels of debt, the housing market ponzi scheme, the water mismanagement, etc.  The CCP will never admit fault on any of them, which means nothing will be solved and China will end up falling on its face eventually."
"‚Äú China collapses everyday lol‚Äù says YouTube 


Nice video bud finally not click bait"
Finally a balanced perspective on China. I also really dislike the other channels that consistently only broadcast doomsday ‚Äúpredictions‚Äù
I'm glad there is a video that takes a middle ground on China.  More realistic

I made a comment on your last YouTube vid and the comment section disappeared.
There is one factor you haven't mentioned is all the off-the-books shady financing schemes perpetrated by provincial and municipal governments along with LGFVs...tens of thousands of Bernie Madoff-type Ponzi schemes all seizing up in a short period of time. I was a translator in China for 11 years...I've seen this stuff up close!! I don't think China will collapse but the LaoBaiXing (the Common people) will be the ones to bear the the brunt of all these shady schemes....it will be brutal!!
How much are you being paid by your commie Chinese masters?
"Your analysis is very superficial because you assume that the rest of the CCP economy (outside the central government and the central bank) is the same in the PRC as it is in the rest of the world, and that the entire CCP economy is transparent. It is neither of those. The local government units have several $trillion worth of off-balance-sheet debt and the CCP's real estate developers have vast amounts of ""commercial paper"" that they have used to extend their debt-bubble scheme. Neither of those is considered by Western economists, like you, and that blindness causes you to make rosy assumptions of health in the CCP system that simply isn't there."
"A very reasonable scenario, but after talking to hundreds of Chinese business students, I am a little more pessimistic - this really is as good as it gets for China, and I am erring on a steeper decline from here on than the video suggests, still with no outright collapse, and here is why.

Firstly, all Chinese statistics are treated with caution - even by their own people.  The statistics China is publishing are the very best that could be taken from the data, while many of the careers of the people supplying that data rely on submitting positive numbers. Therefore their actual situation is likely to be worse than it seems. For example, in 2014 China reported growth of over 8%, while purchasing less oil, hiring fewer ships, and producing less electricity. How does an economy grow in such circumstances? I've seen two proxies for economic growth (night time lighting, and tax receipts) that both suggest (without concluding) that China has grown at an average rate of about 4% over the last 30 years. Clearly that is not bad, but it isn't the double digits often reported, and begs the question ""is their economy as big as they say?"". Additionally, is their debt as small as they say? Are their births as high as they say? We simply cannot know, thus giving the Peter Zeihanists plenty to talk about, with good reason. 

Secondly, the population decline problem is more serious than many people recognise.  In my classes of 20 Chinese students, usually only 2 or 3 had a sibling. As I often told them, ""23 people replacing 40 parents - do the maths, and consider the implications"". This is more serious than mere numbers reveal: who looks after the elderly parents? Who goes to work? Who looks after any children? How many children would you choose to have in such circumstances? The bulging working age population was one factor that propelled China this far, well, this is now disappearing, wages are rising and the demands on the time of the working age population are going to be much greater from now on. This is a definite brake on economic activity and reproduction, and any couple at age 20 in 1980 having their one and only child are now 62, so this is happening right now, and cannot begin to be resolved until the parents sadly pass the torch.  However, it is not all bad news - my students are very unlikely to ever face unemployment and go on another 'Long March'.  

Thirdly,  while Japan has had a relatively smooth population decline and apparent stagnation (although GNP has remained high), China's population bust has been much longer, more pronounced, and Japan got rich before getting old. Covid has and still is exacerbating this further. Also, while people are queuing up for trade deals with Japan, China is now suffering from sanctions and trade tariffs.  Additionally, Japan has a good set of allies, chiefly the US, and that takes the cost of security off Japan somewhat.  In contrast, China has Pakistan and Cambodia. Therefore I think that while China's problems will look similar in essence to Japans, they will be more severe. 

Therefore while outright collapse is possible, I think a steep decline is more likely, with little chance of a solution in the next 20 years at least."
Really enjoy this channel. It's really made me up my Bs detector and be more particular in the channels I gather information from.

"Hahahaha i think this aged well. 
In a good way i mean! Nonense clickbaiters made me so angry lol thank you for what you do!"
"You left out one key point in your analysis.  While the Great Depression resulted from asset bubble collapse, the situation in China is the unraveling of a giant Ponzi scheme.  Essentially, once the raw land was acquired, units were sold to the Chinese public before they are even started with 70% of the funds coming from Chinese banks.  Rather than completing the units as promised, the payments for the units was used to buy even more land, which was in turn sold to the public, rinse, lather, repeat.  Amazingly, the main victim of the Ponzi scheme were the Chinese banks that issued the loans, so we will probably never know the full extent of the damage.  It will also forever be unknown how much of the profits were taken by Chinese corruption, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it is in the ballpark 40%.  THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CAN‚ÄôT BUY IT‚ÄôS WAY OUT OF A PONZI SCHEME.    I don‚Äôt know to what extent the collapse will be and of course no one can ever guess when it will happen, but I think your idea of a soft recession followed by stagnation is also a highly unlikely scenario.   Collapsing Ponzi schemes always lead to anger and loss of faith in government, so I expect a much harsher result in China."
"So, we must consider the social aspect of economic stability. China is running face first into a young society that is spoiled and self centered to a massive degree. The total collapse of the social construct (created by the communist party) is inevitable as these generational spoiled brats decide they don't want to participate and don't care about the outcome. Totalitarianism only works if the people continue to participate and tolerate it...once they stop tolerating it and stop participating...or worse, start sabotaging the system by subtle ""dropping of wrenches into the gears"" then you have a dead system which is seemingly still moving, but only as it falls forward face down. Xi is no fool and his cronies all see this happening right now. The only hope is to put the people to sleep, as in turn them into conformist zombies or kill off all who have a problem with total police state life...we'll see.  But one thing is sure, the west can now see that China is not changing from it's evil natured attacks on freedom and democracy...so China is not going to have easy roads ahead. Diversification of Trade relationships is way better than feeding an evil dragon that will one day grow big enough to eat you."
"I‚Äôm a little more pessimistic about China, for a few reasons.

1 political reactions to an economic downturn. The recent congress squeezed out the few internal critics of the regime, leaving the system vulnerable to political blowback. 

2 The CB can inject liquidity into banks, and stop people moving money abroad, but they can‚Äôt prevent the decline in value of property, which will have a very depressing effect of the people‚Äôs financial confidence.

3 Saving the property developers will be ruinously expensive, and probably some will have to be let fail.

4 expanding family sizes will increase the dependency rate in the short term. Failing to expand it will be even worse in the long term



Summary: They have a huge financial arsenal, and a powerful state, but my sense is that this property crash is large enough to test these advantages. And  when the USA experienced its 2 giant bubbles, the people were able to vote out the govt and bring in a new one."
China's economic stability is good for the entire world.
Please turkish translation
"Unfortunately, I have to agree with you because China really doesn't have ANY debt!!!  Have you got deposits in a 'troubled' bank?  You can't withdraw it.  Bankrupt employer who owes back wages took the last of his money & skipped town, you have no redress.  Is the bankrupt employer a problem for his bank?  No, it was just a book entry that never has to be settled.  Do foreigners own bonds of Evergrande?  Won't get paid.  People only get paid a little if the government thinks people with clout will explode & riot.  This is why more & more Chinese are ""lying flat"" & ""letting it rot"".  Or, if young, maybe they are unemployed.  And we're usually talking about people who are expected to take care of four (4!!!) elderly parents & grandparents when older!  The revolution is coming!"
what do you think after today's report?
They have been saying that chinas economy will collapse since decades.
"You are not taking into account corruption, the people that make the most money are able to get it out and they can't reinvest locally because it exposes it. Like all the corrupt that went to jail with cabinets full of bills. One more thing that you did not mention, which is highly illegal but there is proof of it, is their multiple bills per serial number. They got away with printing double or triple the currency without it affecting their ""official"" numbers. I also don't think they will collapse soon, authoritarian countries have always done the same thing in history. Since recession, depression, collapse, failure, etc is not in their political vocabulary, they start a WAR with anybody just to be able to sweep everything under the rug. Blaming the WAR for collapses and downfalls, instead of admitting failure or fault. Both China and Russia are holding Q3 GDP numbers indefinitely. I believe that Russia will collapse or putin will have to be removed for it not to happen. China will have to start a WAR to distract and then later point fingers for their failure. They have always done this in history, because their egos don't let them fail. Russia was already failing before it started in Ukraine... GODSPEED"
"Export statistics, FDI, electricity usage, leading EVs, solar, wind etc sustainable sectors are doing extremely well. I'm sorry, too much western negative arrative"
"damn it, i wanted to china to implode, they liked gacha games to much and those games are horrible"
So why did the Chines Army sit outside the banks?
Thanks! It would be interesting to see a video on the consequences the stagnation scenario might have on the World economy. Cheers!
"I suspect the most likely scenario is actually a USSR-style break up of the CCP into smaller Chinese nations. (Recall that modern day China has only been a nation since about 1950; historically the region has been many independent nations). From the reports I‚Äôm seeing, the Chinese youth are collectively ‚Äúlying flat‚Äù (a rough translation from Chinese to English). Meaning the declining number of youth will be even less productive due to social tensions and fatigue from communist intervention. This social effect will exacerbate China‚Äôs economic woes.

I don‚Äôt see them likely hitting a Japanese stagflation because the Japanese social fabric is much more stable and their youth seem to be still motivated to participate in the economy and workforce."
"China is very big n has many more rooms for growth in the future. Very unlikely they will enter Japan style stagnation due to the very different ways Japanese n Chinese economy works n their governmental style. In other words, Japan's problems is quite unique n is tied to their culture n govt policy. China will have their own problems but it will not be like Japan.

One of the main reason why Japanese economy fail is because they are ally of the United States and forced to sign some agreement to ensure they do not grow bigger in such a way as to overtake US. In other words, Japan sign up for their own doom, by becoming a puppet n slave to the nation who nuked them twice n then taken complete control of how things are run in Japan."
Too bad
"I could say(ironically) , its good for you to know China wont collapse. The reason i believe you is bacause the bible tells us that China, Russia, Turkey, Iran and some more countries will attack Israel in the (near) future. None of those countries can collapse before this happens."
You have my vote. I think they have better overall control.
"I think the one child policy will weigh as being the chief reason behind the decline of China. Based on sexist societal values, 2 generations of women babies (40 years of policy duration represents 2 generations)  were aborted. This will be the reason for the decline in population, and irrespective of any other factors, will lead to the end of China."
Immediate subscribe just for taking the risk and going against the norm
""
"They have the centralized power and will to enforce an artificial destabilizing strategy‚Ä¶as long as they can keep the lid on the powder keg of frustration. Once the immediate blowout of the bubble recedes, they will be going into a slow stagnation/decline‚Ä¶mostly because the entire world is pulling back from global supply chain with its incredible vulnerability and unforeseen points of entire system instability potentials. Due to irreversible demographic decline, without massive automation, they won‚Äôt be able to recapture the previous period of exponential growth."
"Short summary:
China will not face total collapse because:
- CHINA is similar to USA in 1930 and 2008 because banks overleveraged and invested too much in assets which caused asset price bubble
- USA didnt do enough to save its banks which harmed economic system. CHINA learned from those mistakes and owns banks and will not make that mistake. 
- CHINA is unlike SRI LANKA because they can protect their currency: get dollars from manufacturing internation goods and capital control

CHINA will stagnate however most likely because of ONE CHILD POLICY, CORONA LOCKDOWNS, CRACKDOWNS ON PRIVATE SECTOR. 

Longer version:

China will not face a total economic collapse like USA in 1930 and Sri Lanka today  - Because while China is facing similar problems, it is not the same as USA or Sri Lanka.

1. Chinese similarities to the great depression and 2008 crisis
- Great amount of lending
- Asset prices skyrocketing (stocks and property)
- rising credit growth
--> cities like Shangai became 4x more expensive to live in relative to wages 

- asset prices cannot rise relative to income forever
--> prices need to come down
--> banks that made loans backed by asset prices start to fail
--> bank run (people want to withdraw their money incase banks collapse --> banks lose all their money and fail because people withdraw)

- in 1930 USA government allowed banks to collapse but in 2008 they did not because when banks collapsed in 1930 the economic system went with it and it caused alot of harm. 
- CHINA: will not allow their banks to collapse --> stop withdrawals etc. --> wont face 1930 USA great depression. 
- lowered interest rates
- rescuing banks and property developers

OTHER DIFFERENCES CHINA AND USA:
- Chinas banksystem mostly stateowned
   - China can print money and give to people trying to withdraw and thus avoid bank collapse
- China popped its bubble
   - USA allowed bubble to pop on its own but China popped it itself by introducing the three red lines policy: 
      - Forced property developers to deleverage (reduce debt ratio)

Summary: 
- Disproportionate rise in asset prices relative to income leads to bubble
- Banks cause bubble and go down in bubble unless they get saved
- In CHINA the state controls the economy unlike USA and therefore they can and will put more effort into saving banks for the sake of statbility.    --> wont face economic recession like USA in 1930 and 2008. 

Counterargument: USA controls Dollar which is world currency, China doesnt
- Dollar is important for trade, having too little harms economy
- international investors are pulling out of CHINA leaving it with less dollars
--> It could be better to compare CHINA with SRI LANKA instead of USA. 

2. CHINA is not SRI LANKA
- SRI LANKA faced economic collapse because of Covid, Ukraine war, overspending and being reliant on imports that required dollars they didn't have because of previous reasons.
- CHINA does not face those problems to same degree: they are manufacturing hub, people need to give them dollars to produce products 
--> steady supply of dollars.  (trade surplus) --> can defend its currency (inflation) using dollars
    - Possible problem for CHINA: in Russia and Turkey they defended their currency using dollars, but didnt work because people brought out dollars into the West. 
   - CHINA controls money flow (CAPITAL CONTROLS)  and can stop citizens more easily from sending away dollars. Can therefore protect their currency.  (RUSSIA Implemented same system after sanctions which helped them)

3. Is CHINA saved? No. 
- CHINA will face slow constant recession in style of JAPAN because of 3 reasons

Reason 1:  One child policy
- population decline 
Reason 2: Corona lockdowns to the extreme
Reason 3: Cracking down on productive Tech and Education industry (private industry in general)."
"Would it be great that the business or companies, would give back to the slave labor of communist china just for the sake of the basic needs of food ,clothing and shelter asap. I read that they are not being fed at all.  Come on guys,share your riches for their basic needs."
Amazing job cutting through the crap.
Please do a video on the UK economy now - especially after today's announcement of the new mini budget
This is some interesting ccp propaganda.
"Although those ""China will collapse in X days"" headlines are ridiculous, this video makes some pretty bad points. No, capital controls don't magically create wealth. Saying ""China isn't like the US"" by stating a couple of differences, same for Sri Lanka is also pointless. The fact is that a huge amount of capital was sunk into dead projects and that the output of China has massively decreased and will keep decreasing will put enormous strain on its economy. You also assume China has the reserves to offset that, when it might not (maybe a lot of it was spent on ghost cities) and nobody really knows."
Thanks
"I think this is not pure economics, but you also have to consider political factors. China has not experienced an actual recession in decades, and its government's legitimacy comes from sustained improvements in living standards. So we are dealing with a big economic crisis unseen in decades plus an unprecedented third term - that's where the bigger danger comes from"
this aged like milk
"I disagree. True that China and USA are different, but that doesn't change the dire social and financial situation of China. Banking and investment are relatively the same internationally. The CCP's corruption and days of manipulating daily currency standards, ponzi schemes (real estate), and disappearance of billions of dollars of personal life savings are further collapsing the country."
Very upsetting for an average WION viewer.
"China feels richer and richer. The fact is China is growing slower, nevertheless growing. Jt is becoming bigger."
Even non financial ones do that .
The fact that its GDP per capita is still very low means that it still has a lot of rapid growth left in it. Japan is in slow decline because it's already rich and has nowhere to go.
"Try again buddy... The reason ""China's Economy will not Collapse"" cannot be because the Reserve Bank in Beijing is going to ""manage everyfing""... Though from the video's heading it kind of seems it collapsed a few weeks ago and this is just crying over spilt milk..."
"Collapse? NO,  IMHO it is far less likely than rolling a double six. In the worst case China will revert to the collectivism of the Mao era."
Great video. The takeaway is Chinas economies won‚Äôt collapse like Great Depression of the 1930‚Äôs but they have serious issues and the policies they are taking to address the housing and banking crisis will lead to subpar economic growth for many years. The age of strong growth is over for China but a complete economic collapse is unlikely.
"I guess America's won't and actively isn't either then, awful take, reads like CCP propaganda."
Why would the country that has literally all of the world's industry economy collapse that makes no sense they literally produce everything except for bombs that's America's job
"The last two years have shown me that taking advice from an economist on pretty much any subject is like asking a chimpanzee about the finer points of quantum entanglement, if you do get an answer it's almost certainly wrong.
I'm pretty certain that both you _and_ the anti-china clout chasers are both wrong on China, even though you both hold mutually exclusive opinions. 

I wouldn't trust any of you to tell me the time of day, to be quite frank."
It is so nice to see a sane video on China
We're very at or very near all the dates in those videos and it seems like China's economy is still there. A total collapse looks quite difference.
"This ""make more money to cover it"" kind of policy won't save chinese banks, instead, it will bring more inflation and destroy chinese economy in a middle/long term... In other words, that would make a little bit better now, but much worst in the future.

And not letting money out of the country isn't a solution too, sure it makes it harder for people to take their their investments out right now... But think about it, would you invest your money in China if you knew you could take it out if you need? Hardly right? 

Those policies will surely save China from immediate collapse, while making even worst later... That's even a bigger problem because it might be easier from Chinese economy to recover from a crises now than it would be to recover from a much worst crises in the future."

Don't forget there is also people control too. They are active preventing citizens from fleeing the country. Not saying China won't get through this but it might come at the cost of lack of trust in Chinese banks and real estate as an investment.
"China as a manufacturing giant of the world is in the past. It's golden years of techno and manufacturing magnificence is now history and many people refuse to see the thousands of empty buildings that were, until recently, thriving companies. That includes this video's author. Money & Macro is saying that as world manufacturing companies depart China, the Chinese Communist Party has a lot of dollars to cope with a collapse in the manufacturing sector.  Good luck!  When China uses it's savings to prop up a failing economy, that money is gone forever, replaced with hundreds of millions of techno savvy people moving back to the country to grow rice in order to survive. It's better than starving.  Do you think a Chinese internet tech and computer programmer won't grow rice to survive?  Think again. I would!"
"Mmmm‚Ä¶  my statistics are a bit rusty but, shouldn‚Äôt all doubles have the same probability of coming out? ü§î"
Finally someone honest..... And not driven by Western propaganda...... Thanks
"You are absolutely right. The perils China faces today are all self-inflicted, as you pointed out, the crackdown on the education industry, e-commerce, online games, and finally real estate. Since they are results of policies, a change in policy can do the magic.  The slowing birth rate, however, will be a long-term problem, although it seems all developed economies are facing the same problem today."
Just found you because of plug from EE. Subbed
Sad
First time i have downloaded the sponsor app :) i did subscribe to morning brew. I like how ye pitch very simple. And also i like this content. Bec those people who posted hype type of china collapse probably just want click money.
Excellent content. Subscribed!
"See, while China might feel a lot of squeeze due to the bank runs and falling economy boom, the people predicting the end of China or the fall within the month are also kind of bias. Because I believe the biggest difference between the China situation or really compare to the situation other countries finds itself in, China still has a massive ton of cards left to play. And frankly, if the US hasn't collapsed during both the Great Depression and Great Recession, China's not going anywhere."
I think none of the scenarios presented will occur.  As you point out Xi wants stability and as you point out China makes up 20-25% of the world's manufacturing production but what you miss is that China is not isolated.  Take a look at the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperative and Silk Road.  All of these initiatives means highly productive investments rather over speculation.  This is the biggest difference between China and the U.S.  In the U.S. 52% of her GDP is via speculation.  This is why a market downturn has greater impact on the U.S. than it will on China.  China is a *productive* economy.
I came from the latest economics explained video.
"shanghai cooperation organization and BRICS+ ""mic drop"""
okay Chinese in disguise.
"4:25 Except, y'know, that's definitely and without a doubt not justified from a moral perspective, and neoliberal-capitalist's inventing the concept of ""moral hazard"" isn't actually a form of morality, that's just the legal requirement that fiduciary duty be implemented as a practical fact of ""doing business"" and macroeconomics in such a socioeconomic hierarchy. It is, by no means, inherently justified or moral in and of itself; and the fact that capitalists can pretend that's a type of ""morality"", while recognizing that it can lead to entire economies failing, indicates that obviously the ethical and logical underpinnings which form the foundation of fiduciary duty are fundamentally flawed and not a source of morality to begin with. It's almost like, y'know, capitalism is just a system of socioeconomic-ethnic hierarchy for organizing the distribution of labour in a way that's moderately less awful than feudal-mercantilism and crude, pre-capitalist imperialism, and that maybe this system also became antiquated and in need of revolution, y'know, like 150 years ago, after thoroughly wresting power from the former nobility and monarchies... maybe it's time for that power to, once again, pass from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Maybe. Who knows.

PS: Rhetoric aside, cough, excellent content and I applaud you for not being an obvious sensationalist like the rest of YouTube. Kudos."
I believe probability and statistics may not be your strong point as hitting a double 3 is equally probable as hitting double 6.
"they're communist, nuff said lmao"

"I think the purpose of the current Chinese government is to tune down financial speculation as it happens throughout the world.
Xi's words about a house being a primary good and not an investment are very telling.
They probably mean to make their economy as impervious to financial speculation as humanly possible and I don't think that that is a bad idea."
"He mentioned you, so I saw your video:) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V30VyMMce9s"
"Even though people say a lot of negative things about China, I'm really wondering how much pressure Chinese policymakers are facing from internally and now more externally. It's not that easy to rule a country like China which needs to take care of more than 1.4 billion people in a crisis moment. In the future, China will face even more severe pressure from all fronts like ageing population and their healthcare.
Their zero-covid policy is reduced consumer demand which further eases inflation."
"There is one more thing missing, the Chinese government makes the Chinese bear the burden
The government prevents people from receiving money from banks (Henan Bank), people still need to pay loans even the house is incomplete
The government now imposes various fines to earn money
Due to the ambiguity of some Chinese laws, people generally break the law, and the agent selectively enforces the law"
"whether a  petty trader or a nation, you can't balance the books till your last check clears. china will devalue  its currency and then there will be competitive devaluation. all in all the scenario is likely to be a deep recession if not a  depression."
"What about local government financing, many of these borrowings are not recorded and transparency is weak when it comes to how the funds are used. Such hidden debts are estimated to be between 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) to 40 trillion yuan by Standard & Poor‚Äôs."
I'm pretty sure forgot about one other bad thing that happened to China wait this could have been before whatever but there is a big Heat Wave which is causing I forgot the name of the river to dry up
I am going to visit this video a year from now. Please do not delete it.
"This is all on the information that the Chinese government isn't cooking the books!üòÇüòÇ say China doesn't go into a depression, however if the world's number 1 economy the US is currently in a recession then can it be hard to believe China feeling those effects as we are a big purchaser and trader with China?"
Is this a paid chinese troll?
"When you see that they are selling Houses for Tomatoes, Rice, and Agriculture products it tells you that yes, they will colapse for sure! You are just a white sheep paid by the Chinese Communist propaganda."
China economy has been collapsing every year based on some sources :D
"He may have a PhD, but I've seen a lot of people with phds over the past ten years saying things would be fine.

The economy will bounce back. Inflation won't be a problem. Crash? What crash? There won't be a crash! (2007)

Right about now, talking about economics and having a PhD means you're not using tarot cards or reading coffee grounds to predict the future.

But if you did, you'd probably come out at the same spot as the person with the PHD talking about economics.

You guys did it to yourselves."
"You are right! China would not collapse economically, but there‚Äôs to be a new social order evolved out of this experience. Thank you for sharing!"
"Rollind a double 6, double 5 and a double 3 are equally as likely"
I was waiting for your opinion and research i enjoy reading your sources
I like the video man. I don‚Äôt think the Chinese economy will fail but i man can hope.
"The titles are always Fox Newsish type of headline attention whoring clickbait, but occasionally the actual content in a few of them don't actually say ""collapse"" in their narration and you might glean some actual facts from some of them. 

Nonetheless, the guys creating the content are almost always white dudes from the US who   jizz themselves beating war drums every time China holds military exercises in the Taiwan Strait."
"This is not a good take, you concentrated on comparing China to USA 100 years ago. You failed to explain many underlying issues China is facing today: 

Their manufacturing and mining power is heavily dependent on their domestic construction, which is heavily dependent on banking system. Banking system which uses unfinished projects as assets on their balance sheets on which they get to take out more loans. And the twist? The homes were already sold to the public so their ""assets"" are not even theirs. 
Real estate bubble. 
Inability to invest into anything but infrastructure (home), people are now choosing to keep cash over investing into real-estate (directly impacting banks, manufacturing and mining). 
Bank runs. 
Covid shutdowns.
Trillions spent on unproductive infrastructure such as their brand new trains and power plants which lose money on a yearly basis (this is the equivalent of USA giving away free stimulus money except worse because China has to keep paying to maintain the failing project). 
Reports of people dying of hunger due to the shutdowns. 
Energy shutdowns. 
Russia, Sri Lanka etc. defaulting on Chinese loans. 
""Lying flat"" movement.
Rising civil unrest. 

I hope you give this a read and respond but you probably can't lol."
Oh hey! A reasonable person on the Internet. I thought they were a myth.
"Probably not, but the chinese people will get the whip on the back."
China has 3trillion dollar reserve right? How will such an economy collapse?
"China did not rise to collapse. The two powers, China and Russia, have given a stern challenge to the hypocritical West. The American people have made hundreds of predictions about the collapse of China so far.
Much love and appreciation to China.
By settling mutual disputes, both the countries have to move forward with a win-win policy.üáÆüá≥‚úåÔ∏èü§ùüá®üá≥‚úåÔ∏è"
Thanks for this point of view.
"Yes, very rare that someone talking the truth"
Are you sure you could be a leftist
How much is China paying you.
So China prints more money to have enough money....
no better days big jewel. whos your daddy
It's not about failure in banking system china is creating a bubble and just like it's construction sector if any other bubble burst china won't able to face the consequences
"I don‚Äôt think it will collapse but, they will get hurt by this."
Finally found a more sensible video on China current economy foes. üëç
Nice to meet you today on your hike to the Hidden Valley!
China virus.
"US is scared of China, China will outplay US in the next 50 years or 100 years, but by the time US may start to attack China"
"lmao US market down last night, predicted"
"and de-dollarization, how its going to effect China and world at large?  As World has lost trust in US $ and it has no other clear alternative Currency that they can trust, where are we heading? does this vaccum lead to power struggle/wars?"
"Collapse is inevitable due to the brutality of the CCP.  They can't even provide clean water or fish of the coasts anymore because they screwed so much up...Good ole' Winnie the Pooh pulled the trigger to soon on taking overt he world with his ""Wolf Warrior"" plan....   Now they are desperately trying to mine Helium 3 off the moon as a last attempt for energy independence----  It's not all about the economy and yes, your missing the point of the cruel CCP and its corruption.."
"A total China Collapse 5% or less, fully recovery I think a bit higher than 8% roughly 10% ,and an slow decline for the next 10-15 years would be 72% the rest would be for any outliers I can't think of."
"The fact that the demand of Chinese products or manufacture won't decline any time soon alone should be enough of an indicator that their economy won't collapse any time soon.
Economic independence is one hell of an asset. Not saying this would work got every other country, and as the Chinese population keeps improving their living standards it's even unlikely that being a manufacturer will work for China in the long run, but right now it's a great source of wealth, and as long as they plan things correctly they should remain decently independent for years."
Atleast now someone with a iota of sense speaks!
it not will or not it's  when
But dude you put a little thing saying you have a PhD. I mean it's .....weird.
How to keep your money YouTube and make a video about the Chinese economy right here.
"Uh oh, those rubbing their hands with glee will be very disappointed. China's economy will not collapse!"
What about the bullet train crisis that they are losing billions on currently. There is also all the money they are lending to countries  like pakistan Sri Lanka and African nations that arent being paid back in time these would surely have some financial impact on China
This makes your social credit go up! You can also spend some of the dirty money that daddy china paid you to buy more social credit! Congratulations
This video definitely seems to be the most logical and least biased video on youtube
"Those, finance youtuber are all click bait, although china has some economic hardship, it's nothing like united states. In many places, china is still doing fine. If there is any country will collapse. Europe will be next."
"I dislike Xi a lot and think China has many headwinds the next 20 years, but I am so glad you made this video. It is so silly to think China will collapse in any way."
"Honestly would want to hear China's collapse so WW3 be prevented. But it is meant to happen so someway, somehow China will get back up bully their surrounding nations by whatever means necessary and propagate oppressive governance towards its constituents and multiply the suffering of common people in general. US will probably help China so they achieve their common purpose in preparation for their worshipped evil."
"The only debate here is about the word ""collapse"". They are certainly on a downturn with no end in sight."
Well I guess you were wrong
"can't believe yt is so annoying and is just now finally showing me the other side, arguing against obvious grifters."
"Agree to first part but after minute 7 is where I see differently. Exporting has shown a noticeable decline due to lock down and other compound crisis altogether causing  declining trading surplus. Though china‚Äôs economy will not collapse shortly, but slowly, countries and companies will not see china as their first choice for exchanging goods and services. This marginalized effect was shown in the case of Taiwan after 1970‚Äôs after china claimed a role in the UN. Taiwan suffered a slow recession over the course of 20 years due to manufacturers of Taiwan massively moving to china and also with the help of china suppressing Taiwan in all other aspects in international affairs. This will be likely to happen to China while foreign manufacturer‚Äôs flee to other countries looking for new base and the U.S. government trying to suppress China‚Äôs affairs. The result is likely be that though china will not collapse in the near future but itself will become more of North Korea than Iran in my opinion."
"zhan hu jv  :  I have lived in China for many years, China is a poor and backward country, a huge population, a communist system, it is very bad, I don't understand why the United States needs to be so nervous, it does not need to be afraid of this weak country. I think India is America's main competitor in the next phase."
"With a population of dedicated slaves of Satan worship , Satan will fund them until all evil Nations are destroyed in Armageddon . their demonic military will be big leaders in last war between God ans Anti Christ of Assyria"
"Sure. China has a run on the banks, they funded foreign projects for billions that resulted in defaults
They have millions of minorities in concentration, Sorry re-education working camps. 
Their citizens are pissed but...
The CCP has a stranglehold on its people and the world is morally bankrupt and addicted to cheap Chinese slave labor. 
As long as China owns the majority of the world's production they can do whatever and everyone just ignores the reality."
Why how come untied state steal oils from Syria.
while I don't think it will callopse I do think something bad will happen like a slow decline like what is happening to Japan like you said
"I think we all know what's going on here my friend, we are living in very crazy times. Huge propaganda battles between the West and East are seen everywhere now. Just look at the Ukraine conflict. I live in the West but after living under communism for half my life, one becomes good at spotting propaganda. These China will collapse videos are clearly that. Yes, their economy is running into bumps but to out right say it will collapse is laughable. People are viewing China through capitalist lenses when China is an entirely different beast."
that third example guy is really really bad
"Have be honest. The dice rolls at the end summed it all up for me. Thanks for that. I thought China was collapsing for sure.
But you are right. It is a dice roll yet to be determined."
How is hitting double 3 on dices more likely than hitting double 6 on dices? The probability is the same when only rolling 2 dice
China is responsible for uighure muslim genocide world must boycott Chinese products.
I spotted a commie on YouTube. üòÇüòÇ
"people hears that they want to hear . vI want chaos so , China's Economy Will Collapse"
"You are forgetting US dollar is circulated around the world, relatively transparent economy, unlike China. No body knows what & which extent China is hiding. Reality sector is backbone, burried under massive dept non returnable internally and BRI externally."
"China can always just put all the peasants in 're education camps' (enslave them), print trillions of dollars and lie about it. And so can the US for that matter."
"I don't know about their economy, but Winnie Xi is having a really bad 5 seconds."
China Lockdowns  will be extended till further notice.
"8:43 so, they'll save themselves from an economic crisis by printing money?
Correct me if I'm wrong but, that sounds like more inflation. Not to mention their economic independence, dunno how many other countries will be keen on doing business with them after they openly endorsed Russia on the current conflict and are threatening their own war over Taiwan. So I'm thinking they may have screwed themselves deeper than you realised.
Then again, politics and business often turn a blind eye to eachother so, who knows at this point."
Absolutely agree
Hitting double six has same probability as any other combination
Some banks just declared bankruptcy. Any changes in your math?
"Not a finance person, but it's refreshing to watch a different viewpoint on this. Chinese economy going bust will affect everyone negatively since the global economy is so wrapped up around it."
"10:07 Throwing Double Six, or Box cars, carries the exact same likelihood as throwing any other double, 1/36. The odds of getting a permutation involving two different numbers is 1/12 because there are two possible outcomes that give you that result. We attach significance to box cars and snake eyes because they're the highest and lowest values possible, but that doesn't change their probability from each other, or other doubles. Furthermore 1/36 isn't that low. People do it all the time."
Gordon Chang has been telling us this for years. Made a good living off it too. Lol.
"According to the news and a few youtubers, it will collapse today...tomorrow...the next day...a year from now...5 years from now....Suddenly It's the next super power, lol"
Check his bank deposits.
Enjoy your money.
lets have peace sick of people slaughtering eachother
"This video tell something about why we Chinese believe many youtubers live in diff universes. Even we cannot access youtube, we know guys(Chinese&foreiners) are telling 'callapse'. This is what they want."
"Unknowingly, he makes the case that China *will* collapse. While I never buy the idea of timelines and predicted dates, I do buy into the idea that China will collapse. What comes out of it is anybody's guess. Do we get the abandonment of partnerships between businesses and the state for true communism, or do we get the end of communism in China? Moreover, could Xi (who I liken to a Mao wannabe) become dictator for life?"
"China is really in big trouble, does not necessary mean it is going to collapse entirely... there are big problems, like almost in every communism, that's why China is not going to help ruSSia directly. They are pretty smart, they will not jeopardize themselves for the sake of putler. I think they will not also invade Taiwan, there is no reason for that, cause Taiwan do not want to be independent. PPL in Taiwan are mostly against it... So always have your head opened and do not trust the first video you hit on YT. üôÇ"
Damn you bust my happy dream of seeing china die
Your map is incorrect. Where is Taiwan ? It‚Äôs part of China.
"Amazing! This is the type of videos I like to see! Not just theory, but current events explained in detail.

Cab you do a video on China's tech crackdown please?"
Every country has its own sets of problems internally. Haha. Go fix them. I am sure China will not be the first to fall.
Honestly China will be in decline but I think it can manage the situation and keep it contained. But the GDP will fall a bit a lot ? Who knows the best thing we can hope is that hopefully people won't suffer through this.
"China will and needs to collapse, its an evil regime"
"As a minor point, your photo illustrating the 2008 US financial crisis was of a run on a bank in the UK in 2007; this still was connected to the global economic downturn, but Northern Rock was not in the US."
Thank you! The focus on real information and analysis is refreshing
"If China will collapse so soon, there is no reason for America to be so scared to be surpassed by China. Use brain."
"I will admit that everyone is now freaking out mutch more than they should, but you are underselling it allot."
It's going to be as bad if not worse than the Great Recession guarenteed
All the haters feel comfort watching videos that talk about the collapse of China and the creators of the videos feed what the haters want to hear and make money off it.
"Look, if china collapse, the whole world goes down with it.

If US collapse, it would be like china collapse + FUBAR mode on."
"I feel sad that even though I am investing, I don't have the brain power to dig through how each company is doing, is this a good time to buy stocks or not, my reserve of $450K is laying waste to inflation and I don't know what to do at this point tbh, I need solid data on market trajectory"
"Great video! Was desperate looking for another perspective on the China ""collapse"" story as I had also the feeling that this ""crash"" was overly propagated through mainly US channels and didn't take into consideration the different position china is in. Just looked at some of your other videos and Subscribed! ;)"
Thanks for some sanity
"If capital flight is difficult, what happened to the deposits supposedly maintained by  several banks totalling more that several trillion yuan that have allegedly disappeared into thin air together with these banks' chairmen/leaders whose disappearance have triggered mass protests by depositors? Don't you think that these instances of banking malpractice that should have been supposedly monitored by the CCP's command economy initiative should have been caught early on and not allowed to erode distrust in China's banking industry?"
I'm glad someone else thinks china isn't collapsing. I was starting to think I was going crazy. The fact is china has entangled themselves in the western markets along with the rest of the world so much that I highly doubt they will go completely bust. I do think they might see a pretty bad recession and maybe some governmental change but they will most likely bounce back.
Is China paying you for this?
"Great summary! I agree on your scenario, it's the most probable one. Falling yuan will offset some losses I had to take in while converting euro to american dollars.  Chinese companies really like their american dollars."
Why so negative?!? It will collapse if we all work together to make it happen! Just stay optimistic!

"i watch one of theses video saying china will collapse and i thought ""well thats unlikely but will be nice to see a evil power fall under its own plan"" but as i suspected, red china will still be around."
"seem to me all those ""China's economy will collapse"" youtubers timing are orchestrated. I can smell someone is paying big $$ here"
Eastern sycophant.
I think it might actually collapse
Chinese are well organized
"""How much is the CCP paying you?"" üòú"
Make a video on Pakistan's economy and current situation.
Northern Rock was a UK bank and nothing to do with the US
Lol
It's not going to collapse and might surpass USA economically and throw money here and there to create a problem in the region.
"Well I like your perspective, yeah it's pretty rare a full recovery or collapse in the current state with lock downs or Xi trying to fight for absolute power, but I'm interested in the Chinese weakening for 2 reasons: - first the easy, if their eco is bad they can't attack Taiwan.
-Second my country would be fucked, while yeah a collapse affects all of the world with less products, Chile's economy would crash as we rely heavily on exporting raw resources mainly to China."
"I knew it would never fall. I wish it wasn't so, but China will continue. The collapse is the only way to save us from their crap in the South Seas."
How much China paying you for this?
This makes sense. I found it hard to believe it was collapsing. This guy's explanation makes much more sense to me. Seems like a more holistic take.
I agree with you. Too many Gordon Chang wannabe. China is not the west. Don't use western logic to judge them.
Why are there so many western and Indian bots?
Of course it will not collapse. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs in a good shape either and I know that because you don‚Äôt have to be an expert to have an opinion on anything these days ü§£ü§£ü§£
"u should have researched more - the country is facing internal resistance - 0 covid, stress with neighbours and ccp party politics too.
It is collapsing, when we dont know....guess a PHD wont help you get common sense."
It's fake news until it is entertainment. Youtuber content are taken with a pinch of salt...
"For the people who don't like doing the math, he's put the probability of a full collapse at 2.7%, the probability of effective full recovery at 8.3%, and the slow decline of China's economy at 88.8%.

Note: I seriously doubt he'd stand behind those exact numbers, but I thought some people might want the percentages rather than the abstracted die rolls."
Nothing finer than China.
"It's time to wake up and unite, or it will be very bad for everyone! Friends, the International Social Project CREATIVE SOCIETY is gaining tremendous momentum in the world. People from different countries, nationalities and religions are coming together to build a just society. Only together we can change our world!‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è"
You‚Äôre full of it. Wake up
"Guy, you are a PACK of NONSENSE. China is collapsing, and cannot save itself, unless it can generate ENOUGH EXPORT MANUFACTURING FUNDS - but this has decrease drastically also. They are finished. They cannot PRINTto save themselves, else their money values will become useless - they are NOT the USA. USA is in the POSITION to destroy or SAVE their economy."
I don't hear a very good counterargument. There is going to be a snowballing effect that China isn't equipped to handle that the US can. I rolled eyes at the time frames though.
*Sponsored by CCP*
What is this? Calling out clickbaits with a clickbait lmao?
This China hysteria thats been going around has even started leaking into Russia hysteria‚Ä¶ with people claiming their entire economy will collapse in 18 months.
So now that some time has passed. How much did the CCP spend on you to propogate this propaganda. Now that we are closer and can see the crisis approaching?
I wonder how much the ccp paid this dude to make this video :D
Can you explain more how china stop it's money going out of their country.
"I think the more interesting thought exercise, which I hope you explore, is how the de-lev on many fronts of the Chinese economy impacts some of the developing nation loan program.  Also, how does the the distress experienced in some of these nations impact China‚Äôs policies moving forward.  It is like a perpetual motion feedback loop that I think you are uniquely equipped to disentangle."
"i mean .... the channel is ccp owned its outragiously obvious .... 
1- the positive responses are canned and a ton repeat in other vids
2- you alays and i mean always talk in a reading off the script china is king no matter what the opposition even if its just in general .
3- reality is calling you a liar the situation has reached mainstream news in other places already . ppl arent blind
just saying ... theres a reason why actors are actors and others are welll not ."
"You forgot the trillion that they borrowed to poor countries to enslave them, that is not paying back. Also, that trillion dollars China borrowed from guess who? Yes, US. Falling China would be good thing for credit enslaved third world countries."
China govt will not fall. But the people will
"Ya know, thank you.  I've been watching some of those videos but I'm no economist or such.  They always come off as very hyper negative and very sensationalized.  Especially with some they mention a point they're going to make in the video, then meander through the recent issues in China then never actually getting to their point.  I didn't realize this was an entire subgenre."
" The chance of not getting a double six in a single throw (all but one outcome divided by all outcomes): 35/36 and it is the same for double 5, 4, 3.. So is he saying the chance of collapse is the same as the mellow recession? or that mell0w recession is 3 times as likely - food 4 thought ?"
You seem to be the only one that thinks this that I can see. Maybe I might believe you if you can find somebody else to put on a video that shares your same views. Until then I think you're full of s***
jesus christ stop giving china ideas
It will crash it will happen hopefully
I agree with you. Most people have no clue how much freedom do governments in China and Russia have. They can take actions that are unimaginable in western countries.
Don't believe the west .
"Why are you comparing China's downfall to sri lanka? China literally caused sri lanka to go into bankruptcy by giving them massive loans they couldn't afford, and when they didn't pay china took control of all their natural resources forcing them even further into debt. WTF are you talking about. You also forgot to mention China's 989 billion debt and even Russia stooped paying China's insanely high interest rates. You also forgot to mention the millions of the peoples money China froze causing mass riots."
"As it is now, those who make those videos about China going bankrupt, went bankrupt themselves for lacking a thinking brain."
"ALL GOVERNMENTS ARE SAME.. THEY HIDE AND LIE.. BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL NAKED..


SO, YOU JUST DECIDE WHICH GOVERNMENT YOU WANT TO GET WITH.."
"Evergrande, now people aren't paying their mortgage on homes that aren't even finish and built like tofu."
"Great video, I think the biggest issue China is facing that is that no one want to get properties developed for a long while and this will put the construction sector massively under pressure."
I don't think people seem to grasp that a China collapse would cause a major decline in their living standards.
I believe Too much of China‚Äôs economy has been fraudulent and is imaginary
Ty sir‚Ä¶ im just wondering how yt allows those kinds of bullchet
"Sir, you forget to add one more ace in the Chinese sleeve and that is their Great President Mr. Xijinping. I believe he alone is the trump card to overcome situations that are even worse. His brilliant mind will easily can come up with a solution that would awestruck the World."
"you're probably right, but what kind of effect to the world, would there be if China had a Japan like stagnation. could a change in China's economy although mild, mean a less mild chain reaction through smaller nation states. please explain answer with dice scenarios or make another video. please"
"I personally think it will crumble, just not by monetary reasons, but by social reasons, and on a very significantly bigger amount of time, like 10 years, but the crumble by itself can also be very short to be noticeable.

In other words, a crumble will probably happen but not that big and not that soon."
How about inflation?
It won't collapse it is too big to collapse. But will take a big hit for sure
"I think you are over emphasizing its manufacturing power in relation to this problem. Factories are literally made to be moved easily. Everything in a factory is bolted to the concrete, and can be put on a truck in hours. They aren't a static asset."
Don't know about China but I hope for the fall of the CCP.
Ccp party won't cause its got too many side hustles like supplying fentynal to the world.
"Interesting points, except it doesn't talk about the property owners who are threatening to default on their loans because the construction companies haven't even broken ground on buildings that was sold two decades ago threatening millions of dollars of Chinese revenue, the one Chinese bank president that fled the country with 6 billion dollars while leaving his customers literally holding the bag, the money China is loaning out to developing countries to debt trap them as well as using even more money to keep said developing countries from going bankrupt and defaulting on their own Chinese loans, it's bullet train infrastructure going down the tubes along with the banking and housing markets, and probably even more pipe leaks that are dripping out Chinese dollars out of its economy.

Perhaps China itself isn't going to collapse in the world economic sense, Hell even Russia survived the fall of the Soviet Union, but that doesn't mean the CCP who controls China is going to last too much longer with all these major mistakes REALLY piling up like a dung hill just about ready to avalanche upon the populace. And even if the CCP really does kick the bucket then the original Chinese government that still exists in Taiwan could actually come back and assume control after the dust settles.

You never know... If you flip a coin enough times in your life... suppose one day... it lands on its edge..."
"I mean, the solution is pretty easy. Print‚Ä¶more money. Print 100B dollars of renminbi and done. Yes inflation will rise but the economy would be saved"
"Even nuclear war can't end it i guess, China encountered loss many time through‚Äãout history both by wars and disasters but still exist as a ghost who you think you already‚Äã killed it."
"People don‚Äôt that there‚Äôs an unspoken social contract between the Chinese people and the CCP.  As long as there‚Äôs economic growth and prosperity, the Chinese people will put up with the one party system of the CCP, which explains why the CCP is faking economic numbers and censoring any bad news.  When people can‚Äôt afford food, civil unrest is sure to follow.  Hunger is a very powerful motivator and many regimes and empires have ended due to the masses going hungry.  It‚Äôs extremely hard to control 1.3 billion hungry people."
Finally somebody with common sense.
Shri Lanka is crumbling due to China so poor example
It's better reporting than main media. Thank you sir.
"Yeah, bunch of clickbait."
"This video is a strange deflection. You disprove comparisons to US or Sri Lanka, but that is answer to question nobody asked! Over third of the chinese GDP is investment in real estate. This came to complete halt, as rules changed overnight. The economy lost its motor and it cannot be replaced easily. Leasing the land for building new apartments was the main income of local governments. This income disappeared completely, how will they fix their roads now? Foreign companies move their manufacturing elsewhere, unemployment rises. Fastest growing app in China is the one where you can buy food after expiration date. The population gets old. Many old problems are finally catching up. Banking is in trouble. Chinese central bank can ""fix"" it, its a dictatorship after all, but how will they pay for their imports?"
This is just as click bait as the China is collapsing videos
propaganda?
Your mic is rough
Sri Lanka is collapsing because of China.
"Supply vs demand. So long the demand for China goods is there, there will be no crash to talk about. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Wake up folks."
Nobody saying china will collapse but its facing potential stagnation like japan
"Wish the other videos were addressed more, since that seemed like what the premise of this video was gonna be."
"Thank you for this video. I was getting tired of the sensationalist clickbait titles and I appreciate getting a more thorough review of China's current situation. I believe the slow decline does seem more realistic, but it still seems rather troublesome for both China and for the world economy."
Welp my day is ruined but thank you for giving a more rational look on the topic
Litterally just pumping these kind of materials since like 10 years ago. Nothing happen till now.
They won't because they ain't woke.
How much.................
You‚Äôre wrong China will crumble upon it self as will many other nations.
All those channels are forgetting about the fallout from the one child policy.
What about everything surrounding the Belt & Road Initiative as well?
"Anyone who has read carefully the articles published by Chinese leader Xi should know that the Chinese know the real estate bubble better than anyone. China's currency is not printed indefinitely, and without anchors or economic growth, printing money will only create infinite inflation. This use of financial instruments in China is now converting the entire growth of the economy from being driven by real estate and basic manufacturing to being driven by technology and innovation. They are also doing this by leveraging 3 trillion RMB of investment in science and technology through 300 billion RMB of central bank placement funds and commercial bank credit. Considering the undervalued purchasing power of the rmb, this 3 trillion going directly into science and technology will support trillions of RMB of new industries over the next 20 years, and replacing the power is like replacing the engine of a moving car, there will be stagnation or even short-term regression, but This is actually for the benefit of longer-term development, and it is precisely the Chinese government itself that is currently deliberately slowing down the economy."
I guess we'll see ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
lmao just nuke it and see if it doesnt collapse
"Ccp pets doing work , smh"
I HAVE GOT DOUBT YOU ARE LYING CHINA'S ECONOMY IS WORST YOU ARE TRYING TO THE WORLD ELSE WHY CHINESE CITIZENS ARE CURSI NG GOVT. FOR NOT GETTING.THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY?
"10:10 you know throwing two dice and hitting double 6, double 5, double 4 all have the same odds right?"
"It is very simple.  If China was going to collapse anytime soon, the USA would not be going all out on them.  The fact is the contrary.  China is about to catch up, or surpass the USA in some areas.  That's why the USA is worried.  it is doing everything it can to stop/reverse the course.  However, as we all know, history is a one way street.  If the USA wants to stay relevant or avoid a collapse from within, it needs to learn from the UK.  Learn how the UK transition from world #1 to world #2, #3, #4, etc..."
"Don't see a complete collapse, but I do believe your down playing a lot of other issues, such as there huge loans to outside countries, the bullet train system and the new block of AMD, Intel, and Nvidia from sending and developing there next generation chip sets to china and several other countries."
Money & Macro is wrong and is Misleading his viewers
"Normally, I would agree; Over sensitization to a down economic trend. NOT in China's case (This time); You WAY underestimate the exact type of REAL estate (Emphasis on REAL) crises they are currently in; They have THOUSANDS of WORTHLESS buildings that they CLAIM are REAL estate; They most definitely AREN'T, NOR are they salvageable...HUGE PROBLEM!!! This means BILLIONS of worthless loans, with properties that can't even be auctioned at a fraction of the price...Which deems the loans backing those ""ghost cities"" as just as worthless...China is F'D!!!"
I was starting to take notice on why theres a lot of this ‚ÄúChina will collapse in XX days‚Äù turns out they are all clickbaiters in order to snatch some ad revenues. Now yes China is indeed under a lot of heat but that don‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll collapse entirely as they can just buy their way out constantly only to get into more trouble the next week. There‚Äôs also infightings among the CCP since the whole zero Covid policy is causing a political power struggle. Anyways thanks for warning us and calling out the clickbaiters.
"I'm  no fan of China nor the CCP, but I don't see it collapsing anything soon. If anything it will be Russia who actually collapses, an a stagnation period for The USA. China may also face a stagnation period,  but not a collapse. Some people want so badly for China to fall, unless they go on a rampage like Imperial Japan did, that won't happen,  let's be real. These same people saying this about China fail to realize if China falls, so do the rest of the world economically. As bad as what we know and think of China, they are very smart, their civilization is ove 4,000 years old. They actually learn from their mistakes,  can't take that away from them."
"Your biggest mistake is two-fold. First, you argue as if China‚Äôs economy works like America‚Äôs.  It does not.  It‚Äôs growth is not natural but entirely artificial through loans and the flimsiness is given a crutch to lean on in the form of foreign investment.  It‚Äôs collapse was destined as a result of it basically being a giant Ponzi Scheme.  But, there can‚Äôt be a recovery without outside nations/businesses throwing themselves into rebuilding China (because political corruption and cheap labor) which they won‚Äôt and will just move on to the next source of cheapness.  Because China has no economic energy of its own.  It‚Äôs basically Enron as a nation.

The second part is that, among the many businesses and fields being smashed in the balls currently, collapsing across the board is real estate.  Which a tremendous portion of China‚Äôs domestic industry and employment is built around and the Chinese Communist Party itself relies on for its funding, which comes mostly from real estate sales rather than from taxes.

So, in addition to all the other problems, the core of the Chinese economy is falling apart and is relied upon by a massive portion of the rest of the economy and is what their government‚Äôs funding is built on.

And you say China isn‚Äôt collapsing?  It has far more, far more serious problems than the USSR did and its own government is also intrinsically tied to the worst of it.  Even if China doesn‚Äôt collapse, it‚Äôs going to come out looking very different.

This is without considering that the crutch of foreign investment will disappear the moment China is no longer worth investing in.  And it was already pulling out before the Covid stuff and is being accelerated by the CCP and US government both cracking down on each other‚Äôs businesses and investments.

By the way, the nations you talk about suffering economically are suffering mostly because of China‚Äôs economic stranglehold they gained through their Belt and Road Initiative.  So using them as comparisons is unreasonable, to say nothing of the extreme differences in their trade and industry and foreign relations."
hey one of the best assessments I‚Äôve seen
Are you funded by the CCP?
"Actually you are right, more than 30 years ago China‚Äôs economy was also in a crisis, men slept on the street and ate dead bodies to survive. Then Chinese government collected all resources, including money, metals, food from village to village, to save the main cities economy. Now China is using the same method to deal with the new downturn waves. Yes it will survive but all the people in it will suffer."
So what makes you more knowledgeable than them I truly think no one knows what's going on except the people that know what's going on
"China is done , it is just a matter of time."
"If central bank can print as much money as needed, why are there Bank Runs? Does the CCP purposely allow conflict  only to solve it for political gain? I answered my own question, governments do it here too."
Dunno ...if you need to park Tanks next to your Banks something seems odd
YouTube has been promoting anti China content for a reason just let it happen it‚Äôs a culture war going on rn and you should be aware that wars are fought through news media
China will fall.  It is a matter of time. The time has come.
my bet china economy will have slow economy growth like increasing GDP 1% to 2% per year just my bet...
"I‚Äôll just remind you, your opinion is only as good as what you expel."
The west want China to
China is a Manufacturing Company a lesson learned in World War II is those with the most and best factories win
Ha ha ha.. All the old civilization was collapsed. China's economy will not collapse but country will be broken with many parts.... wait wait and wait... every civilization was collapse by time. So remember only Time. üòäüòÇü§£
No nation fall even Rome turned into Greece and Italy. Only worse things happen is that peoples have to beg on street.
"Wow, is this propaganda? That‚Äôs so much information just missing and downplayed."
"You cannot predict this, but on the other hand there are so many more professionals saying the opposite, so I just cannot believe you. I am not a flat earther so I believe the majority of the information, and after analysing what you said in the video, I also do not think this was all that conscious by the chinese government."
Was waiting for a video like this.
Except China has already banks that are defaulting and China is going bankrupt
‚ö™üêµ
Nooooooooooooooo! This is bad!!!üò≠
In fact China is planning to buy Manchester United
China's economy will collapse if we agree to stop buying Chinese crap. I try to not buy anything made in China.
Gotta love china's paid shill brigade.
"Are they group of professors thenü§î
If they are not, then why do they try so hard to project the economy of China ü§îü§î"
"Very well thought out thesis.  You too are speculating on the outcomes.  Still, very reasonable assertions.  

Good work."
"Regardless how you present it, NUMBERS do not lie. 
the problem with this argument is China is NOT letting the world know it's exact reserves in foreign currency(A.k.A. usa dollars)..

The other issue is that you cannot spend and spend, build fake housing and expect to get a return on it. That is STUPID.. the REAL ESTATE IS KILLING CHINA.. Short and simple. Let's not be naive here.. How many Ghost towns exist?.. how much money is involved in it?.. THAT'S THE QUESTION.. the CCP has to PAY FOR THAT.. that is cash wasted. 

all evergrande (as did the other builders/bankers)did was take money and build a ""shell"" of a home then Stop and build another ""shell"" of a home and did it again until this collapse.. they never FINISHED the 1st home 1st. just left it and THIS was INTENTIONAL.. You can't do that for years on end and have investors pay up with they're blood sweat and tears on mortgages for those very houses just to say ""F'kem lets start another. CCP was NOT BLIND, but with kick backs and corruption that just ADDS fuel to the fire. But Still the average Chinese worker gets screwed as usual. 

Yes china has the reserves and does provide products to the world, but your not missing a KEY point. China is NOT the US or other western countries. China products are KNOWN for being inferior and cheap. Cheap doesn't always get you the sale.  Who buys a jet-liner from china?.. I sure as hell WILL NOT. Cars are just about the same. 

And you did not consider the people. there are 2 things the governments BETTER not SCREW WITH and this is any government. 
1. Family
2. labor for salary(money)

So as you can see the protest for people salary and the banking system locking out people because of the run and the CCP CLEARLY showing a injustice in the treatment of citizens.. that will PISS OFF the Chinese population.. 

This real estate scam ""let's call it as it lies"" was and is a pyramid scheme like a ponzi scheme. which when you can't get anymore money collapses. and now it's happening. it's NOT a BUBBLE like the 2008, it's a Pyramid which is collapsing.. 

Why did this happen?.. Why did this go on for so many years?.. Because NO ONE GAVE A $HIT about it.. as long as their pocket was full THAT'S all that matters. The companies rob the citizens, pays off government officials and then in the end the Citizen take it up the a$$. and the CCP turns a blind eye until the problems gets as big if not bigger then it's self. THEN they deal with it. But by that time it's a F'ken Kraken in this case x1000!! and it's going to DESTROY ya.

Key note:
 do you know what china spends it money on the most?.. military?. food?. infrastructure?..  ALL NO..
They spend the MOST of the wealth on PROTESTS throughout the country.. YES citizens bitching and complaining.. and now you think  the CCP is NOT going to collapse?.. ROFL!!"
For a person not living in China you know a lot! I‚Äôve been living here over 5 years  and you can see the damage  of the economy
"Though China is seeking alternatives, they have 2 major issues to include in the Real Estate bubble. 

One lack of sufficient energy to provide electricity to major cities citizens and manufacturing companies.  Electricity is a major part of any country‚Äôs successful business infrastructure.  The Chinese Government is turning off electricity to whole cities.  

Two, they are having major issues supplying clean drinking water for citizens, businesses and schools.  3 days with clean drinking water means dehydration or sickness then death.  Several of their rivers and reservoirs are drying up.  The rivers not drying up seem to be flooding so much people are dying daily of 3-12 foot flooding.  They cannot drill wells because to the practice of removing water in deep water wells and then refilling the wells with highly toxic water. This prevents sink holes but causes long term issues with toxic waste making any water unusable."
"I still remember when western media said china space station will fall into earth, the day i see  media is no longer ""print"" factual news but their country/organization propaganda."
Map of the United States is wrong!
"I don't buy this sorry. There is so much more aspect of this collapse you've not taken into account, i continue from what i know to believe they are en route to collapse."
"that's why SSE is still down since 2007 right? moccccc üòÇ you should review your videos before posting them.. I am not saying that China is going to collapse.. but they're in a very bad position where they can't solve this just by printing more money, or it's gonna collapse like Venezuela"
"Simple. Even if something happens, Xhina will never reveal the real numbers and they will cook the books. So, collapse is unlikely."
9:15 what about the citizens trust? There‚Äôs been heavy censorship
Very good news üëçüëçüëçüëç
"Well the CCP is not going to collapse, but I think they more have then enough major problems coupled with dysfunctional leadership structure that going to lead to a severe economic collapse that ends in famine.   It will take a different path."
The one lesson that's pretty much been implied most of my life is that China is invincible.
"tl;dr: Excellent video. It would be very difficult for China's economy to collapse, very much agreed (for what it's worth in my relatively uninformed opinion).  The chain of events leading beyond that is anyone's guess, though stagnation is more likely than anything else.

I'm not sure the second point of your scenario will have much impact, though (big economic stimulus). China has been remarkably good at investment which does not produce a capital return equal to the amount spent, which means unless they find an investment type to pour money into that appeals to the now-very-spooked Chinese household, they are going to have a very hard time getting any real positive growth out of that.

On top of that, the booming export sector combined with crippled domestic consumption is an inherently unstable combination that is not only difficult to predict, it also has many ways to end badly.  A key factor in how that will turn out won't be visible until Europe manages to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas (in early 2023 at the very earliest), at which point the possibility of secondary sanctions becomes very real, and the diplomatic tightrope China is walking becomes almost untenable.

The key factor isn't the threat of secondary sanctions itself, but the domestic reaction to the choices China makes, the explanation China gives domestically for the resulting actions, and what the many power centers within China decide they're willing/not willing to do about it.  Not to mention the unintended consequences of those actions.  Let's not even get into Taiwan and the South China Sea.

As a cherry on top, the capital controls will make harder for China to continue even a high-single-digit growth model, since a great deal of the world financial system has now had an object lesson in what the next step beyond capital controls feels like (see Russia nationalizing Sakhalin-2), which could make the soft peg to the dollar difficult to control, with even more anti-domestic-consumption effects.

Sorry for the wall of text, and thank you again for your insight."
"Thete are many different interpretations of collapse. Obviously,  China is in HUGE economic trouble, how it plays out is yet to be revealed."
Never trust anybody that puts a date on a prediction.
"Hold on, your thesis depends on China bailing out its banks, but the speculation on a China economic collapse, partly comes from the fact that China has not bailed out its banks and has major protests of people who can't get money out of the banks. If people can't get their money, and that means they can't spend their money, then China would experience a deleveraging like that experienced during the Great Depression."
Always follow the money. Who is sponsoring all these YouTubers. Easy peasy. üôÇ
I wonder how much the CCP is paying this guy. This is obvious propaganda üòÇüòÇ
Oof... these anglo americans are foaming over chinese economy like some ho.rny school girl. I sometimes worry about sweet anglo americans mental state. üëâplease look for gordon chang for your prescribed dose of copium distributed since 2001.

"The biggest problems are mid to long-term. Zero COVID policies + related unreliable supply chains silently shifts international businesses strategies away from offshoring to nearshoring. Eastern Europe is going to be the winner (for Europe, don't know too much about American nearshoring). This will take time of course, but the process is not reversible, as China is not even cheaper anymore than most nearshoring locations. Wait until someone in Romania manages to start a second Foxconn.. it's only a matter of time. If i had liquid cash at hand right now, I'd buy myself into the Romanian + Serbian economy / real estate market at large."
"It's because we're stupid. My friend was freaking out because Italy's government was changing. Yeah, it does that VERY often, but you never had a vested interest, so it seemed like the world will never be the same. In fact, many people had no interest in geopolitics or politics in general. That happened because... well, we know why. 
So that is why many fail to understand the basic principles because they just jumped right in. I didn't believe the China's economy would collapse... or at least not the degree it was being portrayed. I am more than sure that it were, there are plans in place to secure itself. It will be an awful situation for the people, but it will rebuild (if it came to that). As long as they don't invade Taiwan. That delicate balance of the South China Sea needs to remain as is."
cant deny a part of me was looking forward to the incredibely  open evil dictactorship to fall but i get it would affect us all
Wishful thinking. 2025 will tell.
Such a poor video has such high views and comments. Such a serious description of a small problem. What's even more ridiculous is that you have no doubts about it.
Finally an honest assessment not trying to get quick views
How much changes when you factor in the railroad construction bubble happening in China as well? Hasn't trying to build tracks for faster trains actually put them even more trillions of dollars in debt while not producing the desired results for ROI?
"Too much of Hype and propaganda.
This won't impact China's international increasing Hegemony and US's dwindling Hegemony"
That is China. It is not possible for their humungous economy to collapse.
This is why I stopped watching a bunch of these guys. I hate the clickbait trends.
A nuanced take on YouTube? How dare you!
"For a country that lies about everything, I'm sure the Chinese economy collapsed a year or two ago."
"Under Biden's fake Presidency, China will never collapse. He's got their back, and is oblivious to their outsmarting him."
Haha money printer goes brrrrr
"You been drinking to much Chinese MIJIU clearly... You made me cry laughing when you said the world needs Chinese products üòÇü§£ü§£

"In fact, China's economy has experienced three crises that are bigger than the present. Especially in the 1990-1995, the key to solving these crises is two points. First, China is a real sovereign state. Second, the government is completely above capital"
Still hoping for the Chinese government to collapse
People's lives are really getting hard these days in China
Gotta love of you westoids have to especulate about a big scary recession on china and in regards to recession in America simply change the definition of the word lmao
We are supposed to be a more intelligent race with technology advancement. But no. Another evidence that learning to think is lacking in education. Especially US education.
This is a sus video ngl
Gotta love when a comment that takes the time to actually address the arguments made in the video gets deleted? What's up with that?
"It‚Äôs hard to believe the biggest YouTube channels are shilling for an extra 50-100k views in one video. It seems more likely you are doing what you accuse them of, just by taking the opposite side, instead to be edgy. 

You contradict yourself so many times in this video. ‚ÄúThe Chinese economy is nothing like the us‚Äù, then proceed to use what the US has done in the past as a strategy China should use

Printing money to solve a problem has crashed entire economies before."
"Your forgetting they sell most of the worlds meth and all of the world fentanyl they'll be okay

Thank you for some rational analysis . Now a days every things is driven by Hysteria
CCP bootlicker spotted
"So what if sanctions hit China. Yeah they make a lot, but are also europes main importer. If that took a ban, what they make then.."
"It's more complicated than it first appears. There are other factors that need to be considered. Some of which are not obvious at the moment. Many things can happen, many things can change. But ccp will be trying everything to avoid the incoming disaster."
"No. China's pegged their currency to the USD. If China crumbles, it's because the US fell."
"Oh, look, someone who didn‚Äôt feel the need to try to get me to click with a doom and gloom click bait title. I‚Äôve been watchin ‚ÄúChina will collapse in 30 days‚Äù videos for 6 months. Kinda funny actually."
"Problem with YouTube is that in order for YouTubers to make a living they need viewers, and to do that, they often make the title shocking or ""interesting"" to draw people into viewing the video. and TBH smearing China is a hot topic to get viewings"
im still waiting eh
It's a mind conditioning technique. Especially aimed at easily mind controlled Americans.
How much did XI. Pay you?
The problem is that even though China has became the ‚Äòmanufacturing powerhouse‚Äô as you said the record low of manufacturing throughout entire China didn‚Äôt help at all. The manufacturing sector of China was badly hit by the ‚Äòzero-covid policy‚Äô of the CCP. A lot of manufacturers flee out of China already.
"Really?
Actually you‚Äôre right China wont collapse. The world economy will. China is part of that economy, so is Europe, and America, and every third world country. 
Oh that means they will all collapse including China

Remember this, we‚Äôre on fiat currency and these type of currencies only lead to ruin in every industry. 
Look at Venezuela. Perfect example of what fiat currency will lead to

Also as soon as the greatest depression of our life time hits we will be back on the precious metals standard."
"China will not collapse because most countries have financial debt to china including US,even when UN asked members to aid Pakistan several days ago only china first to move and give the aid."
"China has the ""institutional superiority""over the west when dealing with the repercussions of any economic crisis... i.e. beat the crap out of anyone who are not happy with the situation"
Why not to talk about Europe Crisis?
Are you psychic or something? Communism always fails.
4:27  perhaps the people who owned and controlled it before it ran into trouble shouldn't have just gotten to keep ownership and control though
Everything falls eventually
"Its interesting to see what the long term events will happen due to their population decline, birth rate decline,and the rise of people going laying flat."
literal collapse was never claimed. china is too big for that
How much money did you get from china to make this video
"The West have been saying China will collapse for 15 years. I grow up hearing that bullshit, yet here we are. They're still a fucking super power and a major threat to the world."
"Hes not factoring the cause of the lower housing demand. China has a zero covid policy. In 2022, theyre still dead set on keeping the covid numbers to zero. Thats why the consumer spending has seen a great decline. Also, banks arent the only issue in the housing crisis. It affects construction companies, raw materials industries, labor etc..."
Finally something talking sense.
"I am a Chinese, heard about the coming collapse of China twenty years ago, most foreigners don't understand China, Chinese financial institutions, especially Banks basically all state-owned enterprises, China's real estate crisis stems from the Chinese government to ban the enterprises to increase infringe on the right of the people, so the high turnover of funds of enterprises in the capital of a liquidity crisis, However, different from the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, these enterprises own a large number of real assets (land, above-ground buildings), and their fate is likely to be acquired by state-owned real estate enterprises. Finally, I would like to point out that the Chinese government has never cracked down on high-tech enterprises or the education industry. Instead, the Chinese government is cracking down on Internet ""monopolies"", among which Alibaba's Jack Ma has publicly declared that the iron rules of banking ""Basel Accord"" are waste paper, and he wants to circumvent financial regulation through Ant Financial. Reorganization of the education is to the mediation of education industry, because of the training institutions to ordinary families are very heavy economic burden (Chinese parents spend heavily to children make up a missed lesson), so the government banned the extracurricular counselling, at the same time, strengthen the public schools of education resources, reduce the burden of ordinary families, these policies have been the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people's support."
"You sound like someone that has a lot of 
investment tied up in CCP China.
If that's the case, you need to cut your 
losses and GET THE HELL OUT!

CCP China's economy WILL collapse.
Not just because of the fact that they are running a real estate Ponzi scheme.
Which is more like a real estate ""Fonzi"" scheme [trying to look cool while things are unravelling].
Japan was also expected to overtake The United States.
And look what happened after their real estate bubble debacle.

But in addition to the real estate horror, there are a whole host of other factors.
1. The Zero COVID policy is costing them billions. Which is causing foreign corporations to flee in droves.
Hell, even wealthy Chinese nationals are taking billions out of the CCP Chinese economy because of Xi's weird fixation with COVID eradication.

2. You failed to mention the fact, if you are even aware,  that a lot of China's energy on which their manufacturing in key cities is reliant is hydroelectricity which is under threat by the worse drought in decades.

3. The amount of spending that they are throwing at this scare tactic against TAIWAN.
I hope people realize that it is costing CCP China a fortune playing boogie-woogie man in the TAIWAN straits.

4. But the biggest factor that is going to cause the collapse ofthe Chinese economy is Xi and the CCP.
Unlike The United States, where Capitalism and markets are of chief concern, CCP China's main focus is maintaining power of the state by hook or crook!

They refuse to provide transparency on the most basic of economic statistics.
Because secrecy is power unlike in Western market economies where transparency is the foundation of market strength.

So while you may knock those internet hosts that are predicting the economic reckoning and wrecking of China. You 
need to take a closer look at the going ons in Xi's China. If you can actually get some actual on the ground intel.

Remember that  Xi's role model is murderous Mao Zedong not  the 
economic reformer Deng Xiaoping.
THE COLLAPSE IS INEVITABLE!
The  dates of collapse may make those predictors a bit full of themselves.

But just as Russell Crowe said in the movie ""3:10 To Yuma"".
Just as sure as GOD's wrath, China's economic collapse is COMING!!!"
Question: Is China suffering from a drought?
International investment has been increasing actually
nobody here who is aware that rolling two sixes is just as likely as rolling two twos?
youre right
It will outsourcing you china is dead plus they have old age crisis
"Even if China does end up for a stagnation for awhile, their economy will still likely grow. They said stagnation are 2% of lower. 2% of 18 trillion is still pretty good. The US on the other hand, is headed for a major recession next year. I think economic growth around the world is all going to come to slow halt for quite awhile."
Haha. The entire thing is so hilarious. All those clickbate videos about China's impending economic collapse. So ridiculous.
"Your video is well stated , and you are correct on your understanding of the Macro economic differences that exist in China. I have spent a fair amount of time in China , and even longer studying their system, and I agree with your conclusion. Their manufacturing dominance makes a great depression style event almost impossible, despite the poor real estate market management and covid lock downs."

"My brother and I get a huge kick out of those clickbait videos. The info is interesting for sure, and I would never deny that there is big trouble in China. That said, the clickbait thumbnails and overly dramatic editing of the videos is freaking hilarious to me. It's like watching ghost hunter shows."

How many time has China collapsed? Many.
The videos he‚Äôs criticizing are as opinion based as this. Waste of time
Ok commie
"I do agree that China's very unlikely to collapse because of the amount of control government has, but it should raise enough concerns since the reckless lending behavior of banks and real estate companies is basically tolerated for this entire time."
"You notice the central government of China can easily solve the problem by print money, but why don't you talk about why?"
"the world does not *need* Chinese products - they simply want it, which is different.  What would happen if the modern Democratic nations on the globe decides to stop buying Chines-made products? this is the *ONE* Ace card that democratic nations have to reign in China's debt trap expansion. This would most certainly lead to the collapse of the CCP - not necessarily China as a whole. the question remains, can the democratic nations unite in this effort? that is left to be seen."
"US: How do you avoid economic collapse ever 10 years?
China: üîÖplanningüîÖ
US: must be because you're evil...
China: üîÜPLANNINGüîÜ"
Russia and china BEST friends
yeah but demographics. nuff said
Only one subject you didn't hit on which China train üöÇ system which is failing major putting them further and further in debt .. China might not go into a depression but they're also not as powerful as they say and are nowhere near passing the American dollar üíµ ..
"I do agree, we are not seeing a collapse yet, but a great resession is most likely what we are seeing due to epic mismanagement. This however I think will spark alot more distrust in the CCP and other businesses over the next couple decades, or sooner. Meaning people ignoring the CCP or areas governing themselves more so then CCP governing them."
People don't understand how much economic opportunities those highspeed rails have created. Let alone know the experience of riding in one.
"They need to stop that stupid zero covid policy first.

For now even Chinese themselves are pessimistic on their future.

Even premier Li Qe Qiang want to restart the economy thus contradicting Xi Jinping on that matter. Premier Li even made speech about reform and opening up and made a ceremony in front of the statue of... Deng Xiaoping.
He then made another public speech where he said ""the rivers will not flow backward"". 

That alone should give you hint on the current mindset of some member of the Party. 

China need reform toward a rule of law and private property system if she don't want to collapse."
Now in ok üëç
For stability they don't mind abolishing new laws and regain old laws for example may include issuing of tickets as they did in 1970s because they almost self independent in basic necessities but at the cost of future growth.
Ya you just listed off alot of proploms that will lead to them falling apart should send the good people there shot guns to show how they feel about there rights....the people would do the fighting for us....why is our gov. So damn dumb..im high as fuck and come up with better ideas lol the sad thing is im prity sure its true
"I think you're right that China's economy won't collapse, but it remains to be seen if China can bail out the developers/banks without devaluing it's currency."

I'm really happy this guy whos a TRUE AUTHORITY on China uploaded this video that debunks the other guy who also definitely not an authority
"Maybe China will collapse maybe it won‚Äôt 

China is very hard to judge since china doesn‚Äôt show its mistakes we get a glimpse of their mistakes by media but like 70% of their mistakes we don‚Äôt hear about so it can be that in 30 days China is broke or people revolt to change the regime I mean these are complicated times we can‚Äôt know what tomorrow brings"
"isn't the US trying to make everyone less dependent on China products?

the side effect that ASEAN countries get most of the FDI's to help factories shift from China. E.g Indonesia and Vietnam."
china wont collapse it will just be like all communist governments and steal from its population
"There are so many red-flags in China, and people who have stayed in China for years or even over a decade speak about how china is headed in a bad direction. 
Either this guy has fallen badly to the Chinese propaganda, or this guy has been paid by the CCP (which infact is a common thing. Chinese people hire white people to project China in a good light)."
"Its allready dead, a walking corpse"
"Funny, the ""finance youtuber"" are claiming China's economy will collapse while the people who actually have money, like JP Morgan etc are investing into China big time. I don't know about you, but I don't take economic advice from people who don't have even a few thousand $ in their bank account."
"I'd be more worried about the drought in China than anything, that is going to wreak havoc on already fucked supply chain issues which is only going to drive more inflation."
This guy works for the ccp
And these are the kind of guys that post stuff like this on YouTube that clearly have been contacted by the CCP. And probably given some sort of little monetary payment to make this kind of video. It's not a secret that people do it. But I would also stay away from this guy
The country will be shaken by crisis after crisis though. It's just beginning because they've reached a point where they need real skills including skills from outside to maintain high performance.
That's also what Michal Pettis thinks is gonna happen
"Yeah the dynasty‚Äôs have been strong for thousands of years, but this guru on YouTube is always right bro ü§£ü§£ü§£ (agreeing with you)"
What
"This video is also clickbait... full of weak arguments lacking context. You think the Chinese state can just pump money into their banks when they are 9 trillion dollars in debt and everything will be fine? The other videos at least run through logical narratives to explain why their economy would collapse (even if they are massively exaggerating). Your saying ""state owned"" and ""manufacturing super-power"" does not cancel a crisis, and though you mention it at the very end, the first 3 quarters of your video make it sound like nothing will happen to China and everyone is wrong for thinking they are on the brink of economic collapse. 

And to everyone else watching this. Chinese youtube bots are real. Among real people, there are also loads of chinese bots in this comment section, up-voting pro-chinese comments, liking this video and making weird comment replies defending the chinese economy. So take the information with a grain of salt and try to be consistent with the information you see and process, because believing this guy for saying ""China is not the US"" and ""manufacturing super-power"" is not very logical at all, even if he is right about the future of China."
"I also think collapsing is a very strong verb.

"China derangement syndrome Angloids told me China was gonna collapse in 3 days, like every week, of every month, of every year, for the past 10 years. They wouldn't just go on the Internet and tell lies, would they?"
How much did the CCP pay you?
"I used to think china's crackdown of billionaire's is not fair.  But now i think its a good thing as they are preventing any chance of forming something like WEF. And china is a pretty self sustain country, have good economic relation with Russia. As long as they are supporting each other there is no chance they will collapse. They are also trying to replace USD to become independent from US bs policies"
Man sound like he is speaking in 8bit xbox.
"China is not Japan. You also don't give the years for your predictions. When do you predict china will stagnate and not grow for 20 years? If china was like Japan it would have per Capita GDP of 40-50K too? Japan is a developed country, china is still at around 15-20k max. China still has plenty of room to grow. China is a big land continental superpower, Japan is a defeated and militarily occupied island country, essentially a vassal of usa."
"can someone explain to me why everytime, depression, recession, happen. the damn real estate industry is always the main culprit"
"Another Evil CCP sponsored propaganda, eh?!? 
#Shameful"
How much did China pay you?
"Except for South Korea, the list of developed countries today is no different from that of advanced countries before World War II. The reason why South Korea stood out after World War II was not democracy and freedom, but various industrial policies during the dictatorship. What do you think this shows? If a backward country lacks a strong and efficient government, it can only be used as a dumping ground for goods and a supply place for raw materials and squeezed by the European and American countries. Today's China is still a backward and poor country on the whole, and the primary task is still to develop material wealth, not spiritual pursuit such as democracy and freedom. The next 15 to 30 years will be an extremely important period for China. If everything goes well, the Chinese people can create a developed society with Chinese Confucian tradition that is different from western democracy. Who stipulates that developed countries must be American democratic? Isn't Singapore an example? I hope China will be as developed as Singapore in 2035."
finally a serious video with straight facts instead of the fucking click bait
"A year ago, you could hardly see the theory of China's collapse flying all over the Internet. A year or two ago, many Chinese believed that China's system could better cope with natural disasters such as plague and earthquakes. But it has been almost three years since the epidemic began, and it has normalized. People are tired and don't want to be locked down any more, because life always needs to continue and money needs to be made. Moreover, COVID-19 seems to be less terrible than imagined. In 2022, China's economic growth declined, consumption was sluggish, and real estate was unsalable, mainly because of the Russian war and zero covid. But the two will not last forever, and the theory of China's collapse will disappear with the end of the war and the epidemic."
How much is CCP paying you?
"When you mention bank, I think about the protest https://youtu.be/wVpcXP-brH0
China is a Centralisation,that's why they are hard to collapse, like common prosperity, they will propaganda ‰∏≠ÂçéÊ∞ëÊóè‰ºüÂ§ßÂ§çÂÖ¥ and turning hates to the west."
"In the 90s, there was a more serious economic period in China, but China didn't fall."
Great analysis. Well explained.
"thank you, this shuts down a lot of clowns that mislead ppl."
Soooooo
You were on point for the whole video until you claimed that China would end up in a Japan style decline for no reason lol. China won't end up like Japan because it's not a colony of the US.
"Most of these arguments seem to be among the lines of ""china can bail out more effectively than US"" but bailouts rarely fix the problem, they just postpone it"
"the biggest problem really is the long-term impacts of this, not any short term collapse. all of the corruption, ineptitude, mass mortgage strikes, etc. is going to do serious damage to the illusion of a never ending rise of china that the government had previously soared on the idea of, and used to gain political capital to enforce policy on it's people."
"its important to also note the extent of ""Intervention"" the Government will initiate. 

China has an expense in its national security budget named ""social stability expense"" or in chinese ""Á∂≠Á©©Ë≤ª"". This is the budget they use to employ unofficial enforcers, basically like the soviet secret police. Instead of printing their currency to save bank runs, they went even further by employing these people to beat down protesters who gathers to retrieve who was rightfully theirs from bank to prevent bank runs in the first place. The incident in Henan is a perfect example for what is happpening inside the borders.

As a chinese citizen myself, I would say its best to also take the political element into account when assessing China's situation, because they are much more cruel, and therefore ""effective"" in these situations then outsiders would think.

TLDR: they beat people to prevent bank runs"
"A few issues that I think were glossed over...

China is abnormally reliant on exports: 
Only 40% of their production is for the domestic market relative to a country like the US whose rate is 70%. This makes them extremely vulnerable to a decline in the willingness of western nations to trade with China. 

China is extremely reliant on Technological imports:
If Western nations deny access to Semiconductors the Chinese economy will regress substantially due to the high level of reliance on computational power in modern economies.

China is unwilling to devalue the currency:
Printing money to solve liquidity issues leads to inflation which leads to capital flight. Although people will find it hard to abandon the currency domestically, foreign holding are still vulnerable to capital flight. China seeks to become a currency with reserve status. A significant devaluation of the currency is a serious threat to their growing place as a reserve currency in the world. 
Quantitative easing, struggling domestic production and low interest rates are defining forces when evaluating the value of a currency. It's a balancing act. The portrayal in this video is clearly lacking in financial understanding. China cannot just print large quantities of money.

China risks a Russian style rapid decoupling over the Taiwan issue:
War with Taiwan would devastate China's economy as all of the issues mentioned above would happen rapidly. 

China aged too early in the developmental process:
China artificially stifled population growth, which means that their population will face the strains of an aging population very early in the modernization process. 

Climate Change:
Climate change threatens the entire world. Strains in one area put pressure on other nations. Add this to the strain that China itself will face and the pressures could produce a hostile growth environment. Climate Change alone has the potential to bring China to it's knees. They  are particularly vulnerable due to the fact that they have to sustain over 1.3 billion people with their resources."
no 1 nows if they collaps or not.. both sides just full shit.. china's economy info is logged up tighter than Bidens few left over braincells..... if china collaps.. then it will come out of nowere.. they exstreamly good at keeping info under wraps... chances is they wont collaps.. they just suck money out of another country and make that go broke instead.. they are good at that.. next on chopping block for china is pakistan
"Just as they can destroy those building worth billions as they are pivoting , they can pivot in many ways to avoid a recession. They may have forecasted some big trends then covid hit and now they have to tighten belt , cut back on big bets on trends"
"To be super super simplistic,
People with only 200 years of history and is teetering on a civil war/collapse, is saying the people with 5000 years of history will collapse."

This guys just a communist and can‚Äôt handle that his ideals are trash and crumbling
Lol so they‚Äôre not destroying full city‚Äôs and losing large amounts in estates numbers don‚Äôt lie follow the money
China is about to collapse every second and simultaneously is the biggest threat to the western world.
"I think for the next couple of decades a stable and stagnating China is a likely possibility, but the longer it stays stagnant the greater the chance that it no longer remains stable. Unlike Japan the Chinese government is a one party dictatorship rather than a multi-party democracy. Having so much power centralized in one group makes the system inherently less stable.

If the Chinese economy is stagnant for 30 - 40 years I suspect the government in its current form will collapse. How that will happen and what form the successor regime would take is pure speculation of course."
"""China won't collapse simply because ccp won't let it,"" has got to be the weakest argument I've ever heard. I get it  the china will collapse click bait is annoying, but China simply cannot control their national debt issue much longer. The amount of money has a large chain effect on their economy and the rest of the world. Their debt is more than 6x the US and they're also printing 2.5 trillion in stimulus for 2022. They will inflate their yuan to nothing."
Can‚Äôt wait to find out how much the CCP paid for this video.
Brilliant
"Chinese economy wont fall, they actually use their citizens as slave / paying tax. Education is not a secure way to be stable and women is more prone to kidnapping more likely not to get found than other 3rd world countries. So basically the citizens are fcked, the CCP and china as a whole is still rich, the rich people are hiding, the poor are pleading for their lives, there are almost no middle class outside big metro cities. If it was easy to leave china, their economy would go down, but you cant leave china."
All these China hater being financed by CIA
China has collapsed so much that the US believes it has become a threat to its national security.
"I think China will have a period of relatively slowed growth but unlike Japan, the Chinese economy isn't close to maxed out in development. There is still plenty of China that has yet to reach first world conditions or even close. Given China's control over its own growth, I think it's likely that the rest of the country can still develop."
"If you are assuming a state-controlled financial system will collapse on the same basis as the great depression, you don't really understand the great depression."
"""Never let a good crisis go to waste."" Foreign capital flight, you say. Good thing those sneaky Chinese aren't smart enough to weaponise my jingoistic disdain, fear and aggression. Fringe conspiracy, I know, but I also hear trolls are cheap these days."
"see, China would collapse for sure if the USA asked for their money back or WTO forced China to abide by WTO agreements and pay out on bonds and things like that but we all know China will just ignore everything as long as it benefits them"
"i dont really think china's population decline will have an effect on its economy, first its that Europe is living it now it would be ignorant to not expect china to learn from western mistakes and successes, secondly and most importantly  china's public sector in automation can offset the worker shortage, in fact china is planning that a they are heavily investing in automation while yes they are trying to overcome the burden right now but they can just let it happen naturally  . third and most importantly, china is a socialist state, its goal is not to grow infinitely, but to reach an economy with adequate living conditions for all, and to work within the limits of the environment that contradicts the childish idea of infinite growth, Hence china is trying to produce what it needs, if population decline is happening they will be the first country to purposfully degrow. that's the main mistake liberal economists do."
lol! Looks like this guy has got a fat payment from the Chinese community partyüòÇüòÇüòÇ
How much money did China pay this guy to make this video lol
"I wouldn't say Chaine is doomed, but I'll say commie chine is definitely doomed."
"- I'm so glad someone finally made this video!  Those clickbait YouTube ""Business Basics"" screeds are getting annoying."
Would love for you to debate Peter Zeihan.  I think he has gone out on a thin branch claiming China will cease to exist as 1 nation by the end of this decade.
"Great video!  I agree, the social control the CCP has is enough reason to question the imminent collapse scenarios...but how is rolling double three's more likely than double six's? Btw, I would also factor in sometype of a military operation (external) if the general Chinese public starts to worry the CCP or if the CCP feels threatened by them."
The Chinese communist party dynasty is no different to the other Chinese dynasties that collapsed in the past.
"I can't wait to see how this video ages (in half a year, a year) - then I'll be back to leave a comment :)"
Okay so how is the chinese government gonna bail out the hundreds of billions owed by housing development giants who built massive cities that no one moved into? They just gonna pull a murica and send out the money printer? Cause thats working out so well here in the statesüòÇ
simple answer china has more then 3 trillion usd reserve
"As history repeats itself, it'll collapse the only problem is when.

They're wrong in saying arbitrary numbers and you're wrong for saying it wont"
"Largest gold reserve? Every three US $ out of four are Chinese, clear? Hope you get it."
This guy is a CHINA lover ! lol. Pure propaganda! Time will tell
It will colapse !!!
"Yes  the United States is one of the reasons China has a powerful manufacturing sector because our company's ran to them to manufacture the our goods cheaper, closing factories and companies in the United States laying off American employees. cuz they didn't want to pay them a fair wage and they can have their stuff made cheaper in China.  But two things will affect that in the long run one is after the covid crisis we realized having all of our eggs in one basket is a bad move so companies are now trying to have their items manufactured more diversely in other countries and two is technology between 3D printers , robotics and  AI these will allow more in-house manufacturing and development then we had before. It will cut down the need for labor which is one of the advantages China has now you can have robots  do the work of 10 or 20 men
 Making the need to ship manufacturing overseas decline dramatically."
"All the people who talk about the Chinese economic collapse let me remind you of one major caveat versus the United States while our politicians care for what our citizens think though it is unsteady and limited in the back of their minds they want to be reelected so they have to at least appear like their care what their constituents say. China is essentially a dictatorship their leadership for the most part doesn't care what the average citizen thinks and short of massive riots and violence they'll pretty much intimidate anyone who stands out and they'll do what they want with little consequences.  That allows them to control their economy, their banking system much more effectively than we do.  Hopefully for their sake if they make the correct decision,  it will work out in the long run. They don't care about stepping on anyone to get what they want done, that is one of the powers of a dictatorship."
"how many times have we said we learn from the past then pretty much make the same mistakes.  Yeah not think they people learn from the past completely.  You are counting on people.  Never county on individuals and that is the main problem with China's government,  It acts as one person."
"I haven't actually watched yet, but I wanted to comment first and say, I'm pretty sure I already had the idea that China would not collapse even though I've been seeing tons of these videos. What I HAVE been thinking is ""China is in for a rough patch"" but I doubt it will just fail."
"You forgot one BIG thing:

Many factories are moving out of China - decoupling.

Manufacturing creates jobs.  Jobs create income.  Income allows people to buy homes.

This is why China's housing Ponzi scheme was kept up for over 30 years.....until now.

For decades, it didn't matter that builders created ghost cities because many eventually became inhabited because manufacturing plants came in and provided jobs.

Not anymore.

There is a new trend in the U.S. called ""Re-shoring"", which means U.S. factories are starting to move out of China and back to the U.S.

China became rich because of manufacturing.

Now that manufacturing is going out of China enmasse, their economy will collapse."
"You‚Äôre right, if the people revolt the CCP will just murder them!"
"I support China, Ukraine and Palestine"
CHINA WILL LITERALLY EVAPORATE IN 69 DAYS
"8:30 no preventing people from removing rubles has NOT saved Russias economy all its done is give Russian citizens the impression that the government has a handle on things whilst behind the scenes that still bleed money to China purchasing goods whilst their exports have essentially dried up resulting in a seemingly strong ruble.
whilst the actual reality is that most Russian have pulled out of the stock market leaving only non-russians in the market who are unable to pull out due to putins patchwork solution."
"I knew it, just a bunch of click bait YouTubers posting nonsense."
"Japan never spent so much of it's funds on military budget like China. It is a democratic country like India. 
Japan's view on China is also of same like Indian government. 
More over, Japan is also major oil importer. But they focused on only developments on all sectors, hard working people. The fiscal and trade deficit of Japan is in its tight control. 

Here Democracy plays a major role in such countries as every time people elect their leaders who have different view and thoughts. People support for it as well as criticize one or other elected leader's move.

It's not same in China and Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, & Myanmar ( now it is under military rule)."
"Some of the rich are fleeing the country to avoid culling from the govt. They aren't afraid of burning parts of the field to make space for new crops. They won't die, they have manufacturing and agriculture on their side.

China is in deep trouble if the rest of the world moves on without it due to their zero covid policy. Trade is a dance party and you need partners."
"Ok. Well. You have compared with ""democratic"" Countries fall and rise up against Chinese ""Communist Party"". It's not fare to take up Srilanka case with China. Every country economy collapse for various base reasons. What if I compare Venizula with Srilanka? Not fitting to logic, right? 

One view point is much appreciated in your video that, you have taken current Russian stable Ruble with China's currency stability which may make China to stand taller.

What if conditions are soon to be considered and applied on China for this prediction of Chinese economy instability.
1. Invasion into taiwan and provoking a conflict instead of having diplomatically finding a solution. It is soon expected and happening on ground. USA would sanction China. 
As you assumed rightly, even though China currency may fall temporarily, but all it's exports would be affected leading to trade deficit.

2. CCP internal revolt against XiJinPing -  forget about Chinese people, they all can be killed in detention or reeducation centre in a week or so, but what would China do for productivity for keeping it's economic, domestic needs to run the government with political instability? 
How far they can import each and everything from its friendly nations Russia, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal and Srilanka., Pak?

3. Partially one can accept Chinese banking system stability. In the USA, federal bank never freeze common American savings accounts over the night as Chinese federal bank did. 
That's why people came out on streets for solution, questioning government's intervention.

4. Do you know, where the real estate biz money went into and whose hands are there in that high level corruption? It's none other than Xi Jinping's Relatives only. So, anyhow, this one man power would try to crush it down with finding ways to hide them, rescuing them from any prosecution. But what about the revolt control mechanism within CCP party? ü§Ø He can't kill every supporting leaders to stay himself in power.

What if almost all tech gaints stop accepting Chinese products after a sanction imposed on China by UN and USA? ü§™ü§Øüò≥. China is also major importer of oil and other essentials from other nations."
You're forgetting that the Russian policy is long term going to destroy their contry and America's money is used in majority of world trade and China's currency is already artificially inflated
China could also just turn 100s of millions into slaves to increase production. Seems like a simple solution. Probably one that‚Äôs coming to America too
Can you predict future Pakistan's economic events. You have a different POV (not this or that) it's good.
"Aw, too bad i was looking forward for the collapse of west taiwan"
"The collapse will be a slow one as the CCP will do anything it can to stay in power etc. Bankruptcies where happening before Covid hit and with the lockdown rules, banks going bankrupt, housing crash and the CCP debt from the belt and road continues to grow. Either the CCP collapses or they will maintain the decline in order to keep themselves in power through misinformation and propaganda and soften the blow."
meh youtubers want clicks if u can predict this kind of stuf u gonne get more views later
"Your dice analogy is flawed. You said hitting double 5 or double 3 is more likely than hitting double 6. This is mathematically false, as the odds of hitting doubles is the same regardless of which number you choose."
CCP will take over and handle that pop.
Wrong..China Caan handle hunger..whiteboys cant..
It would have been comprehensive to add an inflationary aspect due to the monetary issues that printing money creates. Furthermore investments not entering / leaving its not about capitals its about how is intended use. I live in argentina believe me i know this by heart. I dont agree that china faces an immediate collapse but i do think its position its only sustainable if the grip of the ccp increases. Thats why i think the communist aspect is also left out of your analysis. Cheers
"Great analysis. I'm pretty sure that China will find its way out, for the system is not a democracy, not capitalistic, and the government consists of very smart people working hard for the improvement of the citizens life, without having the egomania problem which the West has."
"Di video get +10000 Social Credit! 

Good work, you will get your first sack of rice tomorrow"
"Define collapse. That‚Äôs your first problem. You didn‚Äôt define your terms. Also, China is rescuing the crooks. All China has to do is piss off 5% of their population. If Xi wanted social stability, he would refund all the people that lost their life savings on non-existent housing."
"I like it. They will not let it collapse but people will melt down instead. Many world fonds are tied to the China so that can also be problem. Need to be said that Chinese people act differently than western consumer. If their leaders deliver stability and security than they have ""heavens support"" and can do everything."
you work for the chinese government
Ccp shill
"I am so glad to hear an opposing view to the ""China is Crashing"" story. I want to hear multiple interpretations and ideas of what can happen instead of the clickbait title that's exciting to hear"
i expect economic shrinking and the suffering and loss of the people but not the collapse of china. They have to much control to manipulate things and can make the people take the hit.
Germany and Japan won WW2 by losing. China will Win WW3 by losing also
Tell me you were paid by CCP without telling me you were paid off by the CCP
US will collapse as well
Building a nanoscoupe
Hard believe someone that was wrong about Russians warchest
If Christopher Hitchens and Elon Musk had a child :D
The CCP paid for this video - everyone sees right through it. Nice try though
Does morning brew track and sells my information ?
tottaly bad facts of china
"Although it won't collapse, recent events such as China pissing off foreign nations by acting like douchbags on Social Media and their absolutely LAUGHABLE response to Pelosi visiting Taiwan made them lose an immense amount of face that they might never recover from."
You gotta remember folks. The Chinese Giovernment would rather kill 50 million of its own people than let their government collapse. Nothing short of the people rising up and overthrowing the government will make them go away.
"Finance youtuber even informative youtubers are talking shit, there are no news about china which you can learn about it, people like to see failure of their rival, and for west china is rival, that's why this youtuber make this video"
"China gave the world covid knowingly they could have let the world know sooner as they seen virus spreading within there country but as they say it sure did blow in there face trying to keep hush in trying to save face. China collapse is the way nature telling for all those people who died, suffered and are going through hard times due to there reckless behavior."
Wishful thinking
How much you want to bet he has business relationships with companies owned by the CCP?
My man I can see the cheques sent by Xi.
China is also facing unprecedented droughts which have hampered power supplies originating from hydro electric.
**business basics fan scream**
"I think u not have a really idea China build everything on loan ..they spend more that what they earn from 2008 ...micro credits, home loans etc etc.."
"China's economy is definitely dying, but it's the basic life support of CCP, so no matter what conflicts happen inside the party, when they face the fallen of the entire party, they'll unite and do whatever it takes to save the economy hence saving the party."
If China will collapse in 27 days then US will collpase first in 3 days....
"I think the key difference between China and Japan when it comes to encountering ‚Äústagnation‚Äù is that Japan was completely demilitarized and bound by US political influence. There aren‚Äôt any US military bases and governmental restriction treaties with China, so I‚Äôd be curious as to see what they do to keep growing again."
This guy is wrong
This video is sponsored by the CCP
I think the government will continue to bail out over and over with each self made crisis. That will move employment and the economy back to central control and accelerated decline. 'I know an old lady who swallowed a fly.....'
"making a joke b4 watching the video:
Cant have a bank run when theres no one to run to the banks."
"Nope it will not collapse but only because the Criminal Chinese Communist Regime will lie and prop it up with money it does not have, China is already bankrupt and only fools can not realise this."
Social credit score increased +2000
"A big difference is the simply fact that it's questionable if a bank run can actually happen in CN since it has already been shown that with the ""small bank runs"" that has happened during the last month or so. The people were either refused, beaten or even jailed when they tried to get their money or protest against what is happening."
"While I don't think a collapse is likely, I think economics growth is 100x more unlikely. Because of chinas constant covid lockdowns, many supply chains have start diversifying where they source products, and as such more of that is moving away from china. Additionally with how much of a hole they have dug themselves in, I dont see any possible way that their economy grows in the next 5 years. They have ALOT of problems, and while they can problem stop total collapse, fixing these problems will come at a steep price."
You made a valid point. I don‚Äôt believe in collapse of Chinese banks. As you mentioned ‚Äúcapital control‚Äù is one of the most powerful tools they have. How ever by rescuing banks it will make middle class poorer. This might create serious social instabilities.
"I feel china's main issue isn't to do with money of any type, but from the damage to environments and its own water and supply systems. That or its small recession will cause the millions living in poverty to cease to exist, one way or another."
Phd in what exactly? You mention it for credibility but then don‚Äôt state in what area? Probably music or psych considering how many factors you missed
"Better understand both side of the coin to understand the situation  , good video  üòä"
"The titles in the videos are a little misleading, but they do bring up valid points. The real estate market is the biggest market in China. Only 7% of Chinese citizens invest in stock, while 52% of Americans invest. Losing trust in the biggest market it‚Äôs pretty critical."
How it collapse when or the stuff Western countries are buying is made there.
"Finally someone that doesn't say nonsense, and they think I am a Chinese bot hahahahaha"
"read comments, did not see your take yet. Apparently you did not address several issues that are discussed in 99% of youtube videos on a matter. And since all of us are Chinese experts now (as we watched those other videos) - you a clearly lying/Chinese spy/bad expert."
The famous China collapse theory guy in the US himself is mentally collapsing now lmao.
"China is gonna cover up any problems they have, they are gonna inslave any population its gonna need to cover up how bad any situation is in China. China is selfish, greedy and dont care about anybody. They will cheat and lie to the world about anything."
They fuct
"üòÇ I waited for 30 days 
But Chinese economy didn't collapse yet"
How much money did you get from CCP for this video ?
Sri Lanka is collapsing because of China lol
"I'm still waiting for the "" 30, 28 or 26 days until China collapse"" Like Sorelle Amore said with that smirky face who also says invest in crypto, yeah go figure. Someone needs to call on her bs."
Yes it is
"Simple answer: china has 3.5 trillion dollars in their reserves, it's NOT collapsing"
"Lol,  he is good.  He actually understands what those implemented policies did"
Your clearing forgetting aging population 25 percent can't hold 75 why did you avoid that all together ? ?  Your lying
Your lying
"I think it's gonna take a massive hit, but I def don't think it's going to be destroyed in a doomsday like thing these YouTubers are saying. I mean its not that stupid of a government right... Right?"
"Get the impression there's someting a bit off, or maybe a crazy algorithim with the comment likes on this thread.

If you support this Youtubers comments you may well end up with over 1000 likes, but some other comments at the top of the list (therefore you would think the most popular) may have 1-4 likes.

Looks like some resetting has occurred of opinions that you shouldn't have!"
"Thank you for this video. I've been hearing podcasts and reading about the 'certain' Chinese collapse that seems way to easy and to patronizing about them. I'm reading Zeihan's 'The End of the World' and his analysis of the Chinese economy seems way to detached and superficial, even arrogant. I was just thinking that today, so it's nice to hear a different point of view by an economist."
Social credit +100
"Exports will save China.
Demand for Chinese goods, although diminished, is far too strong for its economy to collapse. A moderate contraction however, is all but certain."
"I feel this video fail to address other financial problem China seem to be having, like the immense economic sinkhole that is their train system and the lack of tourism which was a huge source of revenue for low-income household."
"Sure China might not actually collapse in 30 days, it‚Äôs obviously just clickbait, but goddamn it would be nice if it did"
I still don‚Äôt understand so yes economy in china is still bad but still they can control the economy because the economy being control directly by government and there still have reserve from the state bank this is what I understand
"It‚Äôll be a global collapse. China holds the biggest real estate bubble on earth, eclipsing the 2008 bubble in the US. With collapsing discretionary spending and retail worldwide, China has seen significant drops in manufacturing and a bigger than expected drop in GDP. Anyone can look at the data. It doesn‚Äôt take a PhD to read the data, much less making a video pointing out that one has a PhD. Like begging for attention. PhD doesn‚Äôt mean you are right. You had to put it there ‚Äúhey guys, I have a PhD so I know what I‚Äôm talking about‚Äù. You forget a country can not spend its way out of a collapse with ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù printing. This is the root cause of problems."
Great balanced take on things. I appreciate the way you tamper expectations (good and bad) with the dice at the end.
Hahahaja.  Chinese propaganda!!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
"Interesting take, and quite likely given competent leadership. The real question is whether or not political infighting will subside enough for effective measures to be rolled out instead of focussing energy on securing positions of power."
Ok but the Netherlands will be a superpower in 30 days for sure
"Ok I'm going have to disagree with you.
1. currently china is facing down a massive default due to the chinese people refusing to pay on uncompleted projects. This isn't something money can fix. It's a requirement of labor and materials to complete those projects. Due to the pyramid scheme type of practice done by the builders there's a massive amount of real estate left unfinished and under funded.
2. China is and has been closing its manufacturing due to pandemic risks that's been occurring in the most industrial areas of China. Leaving large gaps of manufacturing loses as China attempts to do its zero covid/pandemic policy. With this plus other countries moving to become more independent due to these shortages. Is now leaving what you have considered china's get out of jail free card on a cliff hanging scenario.
3. Environmental issues have started plaguing China. Several rivers have dried up. Record heat has caused their own consumption of power to increase making manufacturing factories have trouble getting power the need to operate. 
4. Food scarcity is slowly coming up as a major concern. China has killed most of its off shore fishing locations and crops are not producing enough. China may soon be facing a dust bowl scenario that will cripple its ability to produce for the world.
5. The young generation is unmotivated to continue helping the CCP. The term ""laying flat"" or ""let it rot"" movement has been growing large since shutdowns started. It's a matter of time till another government vs students incident occurs."
"The more people who complacently believe in China‚Äôs imminent collapse, the better."
Great video! I think that a lot of people forget about the power held by the CCP on basically every aspect of the country and how it doesn‚Äôt make them play under the same rules. The CCP can use economic strategies and enforce legislations that wouldn‚Äôt be accepted anywhere else in the (relatively free) world.
TLDR he thinks they're more responsible than USA
you should see all those videos of Russia's crumbling economy while the economy of Russia has never been that strong.
You left out China trying to take over Taiwan and then using that to take them out of the economic situation they are in as of now
Video brought to you by the CCP.
Collapse because China has pist off the United states
Appreciate it brother
"I feel people miss that to many people are going out of work in china. 
if 15% suddenly has no money to spend then up to 40% will loose their job due to the 15% not buying anything. 
They need to start MEGA big project like the US did when they built higways all across the US to give people work.
Also manufactoring Giant means dependent on the rest of the world having money to spend on stuff. 

Russia does not have much of a monetary system they just changed what numbers they picked up. (the US does the same)
Also russian stocks cant be sold by foreigners so it will flat line forever.

If china falls it will be due to the current covid 0 policy or the wheater / water war with other countries that depend on water that china built dams over."
"Let it burn, all of it, BURN!  But it‚Äôs all garbage news like everything in the news."
"...so your saying that we won't get to see the Chinese people realize that they hold the power and begin stringing CCP leadership from light poles like they belong?

Pity. I had money on a bet that china falls apart and has a good little civil war that stops their ambitions for the next few decades or so."
Because western society fetishizes the collapse of other countries and civilizations
Me thinks this video was made for Chinese monetization.
"Socialism does not work is a matter of time, ask Hitler how National Socialism went."
"Funny, that short clip of the US capitol was actually a clip of the capitol of Arkansas, which looks similar."
excellent video. looking forward to watching more!
"On your 2nd point. They provide money. But with interest rates to be paid back. They are broke. Because of loans. But ccp will give them another loan to bail them out.... not FREE money like the USA. So yeah its worse than the great depression. And the collapse is going strong. 33.33% of their economy is in real estate. Nobody wants to buy real estate their anymore.... the people can get access to money. All 3 things I've said points directly to a collapse. Not like the USA great depression so it can't be
.. smh. Your the click bate guy. Do research on how a economy works.... then talk about why they ARE going in a collapse currently. Discluded the mass shut downs. The mass lock downs for the co of vids.... ffs. What a terrible video... if you got a grade in school this would be a 50%  since you started it out with actual facts..."
i just got one of hes videos that said why russia is making more money than ever
The delusional redditors arent gonna like this one
when chinese economics reporters say otherwise i tend to lean on what they say - having a good insight into the CCP gives you an edge.
Yup basically what I knew
thanks for reminding us to stick to the qualified youtube users and not fakes. 
Okay gotta say I do agree because even if China is in debt $1 trillion that still doesn't even come close to the $30 trillion Dollars that the United States is in debt and every year we raise the national debt limit instead of paying things off
I commented in each of those vids their economy is fine the ppl may suffer but the economy will be just fine and dandy
"In summery . China are dumb like us politicion.
Us are greedy and I my familie work there so I have no hate"
"Grand Steph is only clikbait. .

 I hate his cikbait tilte.
Grand 
And I don't see reason. For his god like satuts on y4outube"
How much did the CCP pay you lol
"Sensible position to take.  I do think China has the potential to collapse but it is very unlikely as you say, and it depends on a lot more factors such as the covid lockdowns, drought and crop yields in addition to whatever policy decisions the CCP makes.  The sensational headlines sell, but they are mostly just blowing individual issues out of proportion to the whole picture."
"tbh this sounds alot more plausible than china going up in flames completely, especially when take into consideration all the points u brought up. and no that doesnt mean its not going to face tough times, but hardly as bad as alot ppl made it sound/look the past days and weeks"
"As a Chinese Im finding these influx of China collapsing soon cope videos fucking hilarious. Like these China haters are making these videos to help them cope with their own collapse.

I can almost imagine these cultists going Jonestown once China doesn't collapse."
Post was definitely made by a Chinese soy puppet hahahahahaha. Why did u put this effort to expose the treatment of Muslims in china?‚Ä¶.right‚Ä¶right when a group of being of being ethnically cleansed and families ripped apart by the army. Had 600k chances to talk about something that actually needs attention
"Of course, Youtubers are making those videos to lure indians and get views XD"
Awww c'mon. Can't we dream?
You made some very good points but completely forgot to mention China's real estate market/bubble which I believe is just as important if not more so than the whole banking problem unlike in most countries.
CCP is experiencing their second largest huddle in terms of social stability
"Video too short, can't stand anymore Swedish youtubers, shirt is opened for no reason. Imma get back to mru"
"Yeah, the economy is probably in trouble, but they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. 
I appreciate the fair and even headed approach to analysis. I‚Äôm tired of listening to algorithm chasers"
"FINALLY! Holy fuck I thought everyone went mad with clickbait about China collapsing! I'd wish nothing more, but it won't happen,  unfortunately. 
Thank you for making this."
The only economy who's collapsing is EU and USA
"Thank you for this..
Whenever American Media is spreading propaganda and lies about another country, you know they're trying to divert their masses' attention for horrible shit theyre trying to get away with."
"You are speaking from a purely informational standpoint and logic. What you missed is China has, does and will hide the level of failure long enough for high party officals to come out without serious asset reduction, you have missed humans are inherently illogical being based mostly in the emotion of fear, which news networks feed enmasse for ratings, you have also refused to read one of the banned books the one the has something about 4 horseman and the new whore of Babylon. 

It might not be China collasping but what we do today is wholly unsustainable and is bound to implode at some point. The longer our societies maintain it, the worse its going to be. 

What you need is a clean water source, a place of 1.5 to 2.5x sustainable agriculture the excess can be traded for unproducable goods, and a place fortified again raiders and marauders as they will be in profusion for avout 2 years as rss are used up."
"Your scenario is weak. You should think that if the economic collapse is echoed by middle class dissatisfaction to the Communist party economic and political policy. When Falun gong member tortured by Communist party, the majority china people not moved. Because the gun is not pointed to them. But when the gun pointed to them like in the case of zero covid policy nor ever Grande and other giant bubble economic explode, you will see the chaos in china and the Communist's economic  will fall, And  of course if jiang zemin faction is fight back to usurp xi jing ping faction, it will be fastening the process."
Not like people outside of the Chinese government know the data.. can‚Äôt say how much external and internal debt China has
"Its a symbiosis, we need china cheap manufacturing, and china need us, otherwise their economical system will crash!"
"True, comparing the USA economy with that of China is...well something mainly USA citizens do. However and exactly because it is a completely differently economy there are a few assumptions here that can't be taken for granted. 1 - The extent and source of who knows how much of their actual debt is undetermined. Chinese entrepreneurs are well known for their ""artful"" accounting system, the main reason being the kind of government they have. Credits, loans, etc. from the private sector, both national and international, are not always adequately registered and by ""not always"" I mean at least 50%. Then there's the government economical and political strategies. As you surely know many regions are deeply in debt following a Ponzi scheme of sorts speculating with grants and funds in a loop that went on for a decade. Sure the Central bank has finally taken measures but the questions are: Are they enough? What side effects will they bring?
Sure, China is economically independent, sort of, for it still works within the international market. Stamping money to cover one's internal debt doesn't work, it never has, it never will. It can mask the fall in the short term, a bridge of sorts, but it will only deepen the problem if that's the only measure they take. Besides it will lower future expectations something that will lead not to bankruptcy (not in this case) but to lose their precious monetary independence.
Again I agree it is premature to talk about collapse although, if only this credit crisis was the problem China has to face I am sure they would be more than able to deal with it, I am also sure I would not like to know the hows but it would be dealt with. The International economical scenario, the pandemic, which I am tired to point out is not yet over, and last the Ukraine and Taiwan issues can and will stress China even further. 
Please, the comparison with Sri Lanka's economy? Really? Size matters (China's 2800 billion historical annual GDP as opposed to 22 billion from Sri Lanka). Then again Sri Lanka was an English colony for more than a hundred years which radically changed and shaped their economical and social structure so I won't even compare it with China either. In that sense it is almost like the comparison Simpletons do with the USA economy.
Finally, we are getting to the season finale of ""keeping up appearances"" in this joke our global economy has turned into. China's hypothetical economical collapse is not what worries me the most... at all. There's still time to wake up and smell the coffee, barely, at least I hope so. If we don't there will not be enough brioche to make it through, how it will develop is anybody's guess with a huge chance of being a monumental step backwards."
this video seems off for some reason.. isn't chinas economy/GDP made up of like 30% housing market shit that's pretty freakin bad plus there main river has dried up while another part of the country is flooding again and again 0 covid policy
How is 2x3 dice more likely than 2x6? :D
I love watching the anti-China economic propaganda as a bit
Chinese propaganda filled with bots liking it..
Well we can only hope that it does.
The analysis is quite wrong to be Frank.
Yeah this guy is a Chinese bot
Chinas econmy may not fall but INVESTOR CONFIDENCE will never be the same when all this money magicly disappears. China cannot be trusted as a buisness partner like they were back in the early 2000s and any company who keeps manufacturing here is a promoter of slavew labor and tyranny
UNFORTUNATELY!
There is too much clickbait on the situation.
damn it
Analyzing China‚Äôs economy purely from the economic aspect reveals people from the west know little about China.
Hear me out here‚Ä¶what if all this ‚ÄúChina is collapsing‚Äù YouTubers are being sponsored by china to change the narrative‚Ä¶what‚Äôs better than everyone betting against you and then you come out on top‚Ä¶also if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs human rights record is as filthy as china is‚Ä¶it kills 2 birds with one stone‚Ä¶change the narrative and also build up for a good comeback‚Ä¶I mean the sheer number of people so positive of china collapsing is so much it looks a bit fishy to me.
The China is going to collapse videos are just what we *want* to believe. The reality is we should do something about it
"It is propaganda, what Western people want to listen + hipe"
"I'd say it is somewhere in between the ""click baiters"" and this mouthpiece for the CCP."
"Anything against their west propoganda are considered as ""paid by CCP"". No wonder the West is so corrupted today."
"Thanks Dr. Joeri for the sensible analysis. Stumbled upon your channel through Plain Bagel and was immediately fascinated by your topic of coverage as well as your way of explaining concepts in simple manners. Compared to other YouTube channels who mainly just wanted to get viewership and appease their audience (which we all know, those that just wanted to live in their ""Karen reality""), you are probably one of the few that speaks out what's going on through economist's POV. Keep up the good work Dr., with you being around, YouTube doesn't seem as fabricated as it may be now."
"september 17th, the great chinese collapse! some rando's on youtube claims this so it must be true. >.>"
Double 1 is WW3
"Yeah I think that China is enevitablly going to collapse,  communist can't help themselves but to break the bolt when already too tight."
tdlr: this video is exactly the fucking same as the other ones but with different clickbait and some condescension
Westerners have been saying that China is gonna collapse since 1990 lol
"Money Macro, where do you buy your clownshoes at?"
God doesn't play dice
Those uploaders are paid to upload those shits by certain government.
I wonder how much China paid for this one
"double 6 is equally possible than double 5, double4... double 1 (1/36)"
"I agree, but some of these ""clickbait"" does give good insight, some even going against their clickbait. Tbh good u cover this cus people tend not to check sources if they arent presented"
Great that I found this channel
It won‚Äôt crumble for sure but us who live inside the wall are literally fucked because many of us will actually go bankrupt or lose everything we‚Äôve built.
"I think the one child policy problem is often overlooked, with automation they could overcome the declining workforce but at that point europe/na wouldn't need to relocate and they could just build in-house or relocate to other developing asian/african countries with lower wages. Especially the next decade there will be a drastic reduction in the workforce (about 100 mln) and a sharp increase in the retired population."
Bruh you comparing china with a small island nation?
"Finally someone tackling the ignorant, clickbait making, money begging, product shilling whores posting nonsense about the Chinese economy."
Just looking at economics this makes a lot of sense but there is such a huge social aspect to this with a loss of trust in chinese banks not to mention the thousands of online chinese only bankers that just lost their life savings since the chinese style of banking insurance did not cover them. It is such a huge loss of trust in the banks and chinas government...
How much money did the CCP give you for this vid I wonderü§îü§î
"Yeah, I completely agree. China is fucked, but not fucked without beyond"
agreed
"As an export dependant country, with the global financial state we find ourself in, do you honestly believe that China would somehow be less affected by it?
I would say it's the opposite. Especially since we see indications not only for inflation, but rather stagflation. This means that China could be the worlds biggest manufacturer of everything, but who is going to buy the products? Also, lowering the interest rates are not a sign of good economy at this point. It's a temporary fix that will lead to even worse problems further down the road. That is what happens when you base your national economy on loans.

Remember, China is very dependant on stability, as you yourself claimed. The CCP will most likely have their hands full with internal struggle, their covid response (due to an old Chinese folklore legend) has been very harsh, and there's a whole lot of... let's call it ""angry people"". I think you're overestimating Chinas possibility to recovery here, since it's so dependant on ""stability"" (read: The state and the CCP). China has been saber rattling for a long time now, and a wounded tiger is very unstable and dangerous. The only option China will have, if instability increases (which it most likely WILL do), is to find an external enemy.

Most people know what that will lead to."
"yes all the other finance youtubers are idiots, only you are the credible one. *cough*"
"I believe China‚Äôs economy will not collapse rapidly,but I believe it will get into a long term recession."
to be honest i hope you are correct. but im not seeing it. i think a collapse is likely due to the high percentage of economy being in the housing market bubble.
"Hope that your scenario is right because we will all suffer from the fall out of a Chinese fall worldwide. Personally however, I think that we have all borrowed our way into uncharted territory and I am not sure that the new rules are known. The proponents of MMT may have much to answer for. It depends on how the Chinese population are going to respond to having their life savings stolen. Either way, time will tell. The Chinese are fond of saying ‚Äúmay you live in interesting times‚Äú!  Nailed that then."
"Something to consider about the great depression: it worsened due to governmental policies at the beginning of it and was elongated by the policies of Roosevelt, it could've been less severe if these two things weren't at play.
Also: don't discard natural disasters and, in the case China, manmade disasters, both of which are now occurring.
What do I mean? The current drought in China is severe, but the rolling blackouts (Hydroelectric power isn't that significant in China) and rivers drying up are very much affected by the CCP policies and management (and the quality of the projects themselves).
Not to mention the social rot that's going on due to... The system... And the fact that there are no big Chinese corporations which aren't tied to the CCP (they are required by law to have a CCP cell in the company and letting its leader being on high position) means you get the potential of having something very very nasty to occur (and that's without mentioning the lockdowns).
There's gonna be a collapse, the question is how bad it's going to be and when would it happen, the current system just can't go on like this.
If it was purely economical? Then you're right, it's unlikely to do a number on the CCP, but it's not only economical, especially in a country which most sectors are so heavily connected to the regime (which isn't the case in the west)..."
"Sure, maybe it won't happen in China, because of the 'special' political regime they have, but if it doesn't, it will drag the rest of the world down, while it remains 'standing', rendering China, totally unreliable (moneywise), for the rest of the world, if it doesn't take it 's responsabillity. This is also only so, if China stays in controll, of it's people, because they are also starting to riot, because of all the financial scandals happening there. If they can controll their ppl, the rest of the world is down the drain, if they can't & a massive revolt happens, then the whole world is down the drain, in a massive depression, even greater than 1929/1930..."
Garbage
A good video but your microphone needs a better placement
Isn't it funny when all it takes is one video that sides with your views for people to completely change their minds. I hear tanks.
"With the blessing of Dalai Lama, may china's economy remain strong. If there is famine in china, common people die in millions, while ccp officials continue to dine on 5 course meal, and sip imported chamoagne."
You deliver excellent content to your audience. It's very interesting material. All of your effort put into creating this video is much appreciated. I'm truly grateful for your help!
"So if china's central bank gives money to the banks or prints more of it (which they need to do), wouldn't the country go into hyper infllation? and hence a recession per se? 

I think there is a litlle of useful video in your GCP propaganda lol"
30% of China's GDP is construction and selling properties. And many of these are empty and pure speculation. Almost all buildings are built very poorly and really not worth anything anyway in reality. And it was all built with debt. Many local goverment also funded their Day to Day budgets by leasing out property for 99 years.
Nah guys this guy is being held hostage
thx socialism
china is staying afloat only by pumping money into their economy. Im sorry to say that but this vid is biased towards the bs china say themself with the typical skipping over the issues as if avoiding them will make them non existant.
another video propaganda from evil communist china
How dare you speak the truth
"China's more likely to make a recovery than Japan namely because, unlike Japan, it is not under the US political sphere, therefore not having to take suicidal monetary decisions that will greatly reduced its competitiveness as the Plaza Accords did."
this world was never real you will never see real wars in our life  all media is lies  good luck humans
"Thanks a lot. Fast, well explained and fundamented."
"Sri Lanka's collapse was caused by China mismanaging them into the ground

China is so insanely corrupt in ways this guy seems to be tip-towing around mentioning.. but he's right, China is not America, they're way worse at everything lol"
"Great """
The real problem is their leader mark my words
There are also a few other problems brewing in China that make this worse first of all China is curently literally running out of electricity because in a lot of regions there is such a major drought coupled with a heat wave that there is just Noth enout water even for the massive 3 gorges dam. Than there is also the fact of a changing ethic in China with the trends if laying flat and letting it rot now even taking hold in business man and than ofc the destructive 0 covid police all pressing down on the trade sirpulss ad not as much can be prodeused also the Chinese steel industry is in free fall as less buildings are buind meaning a lot less steal is needed.
I would expect more likes on this video given the dominance of Chinese bots.
In summary: only white countries will rise. others will just decline.
wow 1st channel i see in the news that is more realistic. not just fear porn peadelers.
China is large enough and has enough natural resources and people (even if the age-based population decline is taken into account) to go full on isolationist and still prosper.
China is a time bomb regardless
10000000+ social  credits
"Maybe not the most popular opinion of my here, but I‚Äôm really think that this wave of videos about China‚Äôs collapse in several weeks is one big propaganda campaign."
7:44 3 cents is not a collapse....
"More money will be printed. Same as every country does. 
World debt is now up to $300+ trillion"
So how much are the Chinese paying you to run propaganda?
"if RE market collapses, which it absolutely should in China (and Russia for that matter), it will trigger the decline in concrete, steel, oil, etc, production. I think the biggest risk to Chinese economy is it's population size. If (and when) the collapse comes it will force millions of people out of jobs. A 3% increase in joblessness in the US, for example, isn't that big a deal by actual number of people who loose their jobs, but for 1,4 billion people in China a 3% increase would amount to millions. And that is dangerous on all fronts, from food security to financial support to people actually revolting against the government. Now imagine a 10% increase in jobs lost... I think the biggest threat is there, not in banking system which gets bailed out all the time, we even got used to it. Plus we might have a crash just from realizing that China has reached its peak! China is at its maturity state and unless something is done, like a change in political system (which will never come on its own without some sort of revolution), it will decline. How fast the decline will be and what shocks await us is hard to predict since none of us can see future. But my concern remains that China is overblown and at its economic and political peak, and there are bubbles especially in RE, and a small increase in jobs loss percentage wise amounts to huge increase numerically and that in turn may trigger social crisis. Economic, political and social crises are not a good mix..."
"Damn
That's too bad."
"china's economy will shrink in future...BRI failing, debt trap awareness, banks bad reputation and the Taiwan issue.. ... global companies are considering this.... their finance are going to hurt a lot more  in future.."
Capital controls == Zero public trust.  You can't grow that way.  Also China having one fifth of manufacturing is in line with their overall percentage of the population... perhaps we should stop crediting their manufacturing prowess altogether.
"""Easily offset...""  @ 7:33 ... That's where you lost me.  China is much more of a bubble than you're acknowledging."
We I know. I just wish though!
Well hmmm if you see these kind of vids maybe some of the people are paid to do that for people who have margin positions or options contracts for usd/chy rates
"Anyone excited and or waiting on ‚ÄúChina‚Äù economy to collapse is an absolute brainwashed by western media and and Governments! Simple and easy, China is running a space station in space on their own! China is the main manufacturer of the world, they just started! Do I fear their Gov?! Absolutely, you should never trust a government, thanks to the lessons taught by Western world! All these BS on online is part of US empire propaganda campaign! The American empire lost, badly and for ever! It‚Äôs in falling stages, that‚Äôs the reality we live in! A new world powers are rising again against the old imperialist and colonial owners of the world! Will it survive, that‚Äôs the questions?! The Americans won‚Äôt go easy, since they are the only humans that actually used Nukes against another humans and won‚Äôt hesitate to use it again I think! The good thing, American empire is dying, it‚Äôs preparing its last wish."
"What about people are not being allowed to withdraw money, and others are refusing to make payments on their mortgages for houses that yet to be built. Even CCP officials have told citizens to buy more homes. Couples are still only having one child since that‚Äôs what they grew up with leading to more population decline. And why don‚Äôt you ever mention CCP? Just say China. Odd"
"This guy is an idiot and he doesn't understand economics. Fiat money always fails. It doesn't matter how big the economy is. It is just a harder fall. We are the biggest fiat economy so it makes sense Congress made fake money work longer. This isn't depression, recession. It is failure on an epic scale. The guy in this video looks intoxicated."
China: social credit +1
"It won't collapse, right. As Major General John Sedgwick said at Spotsylvania on May 9, 1864, ""Those damn rebels couldn't hit the side of a barn at..."" when he was killed by a Confederate sharpshooter."
"you forgot to mention  the large ecological disaster that a good chunk of their food exports are actually dried up husks and are forcing people to artificially seed rain clouds. not to mention their power grid is directly affected by their rivers and dams, which have been drying up leading to lack of productivity in factories, farms and cities with many having rolling blackouts regularly."
C milk and Winston said it first
"It seems like You don't know that China is facing more droughts and the mistrust from its people.
Yeah China's economy will not Collapse but in the process of having more debt.
https://youtu.be/JpJoAkLEPDU"
Wow first time on channel great video. Subscribed
Watched the whole vid ... would say your totally right ... the real question ...  what is the real effect of how less children in China becomes an issue like it is now in Japan ?
I don't care if they collapse just give em a revolution and free those people.
Hm i guess thats fair. Tbh people just want china to be better that's why they want something to go wrong to blame the ccp for
rolling a double 3 is just as likely as rolling a double 6
"Didnt china play a role on the much smaller nations economies that are currently declining/collapsing. Also can chinas government even afford to buy away the markets debt without inflation destroying it first? What about the other massive industrial bubbles they have as well. And isn‚Äôt the 3 house rule a bit lacking in timing to be considered anything but a swing in the dark? Your right the collapse won‚Äôt be anything like americas but with the rate at which they have pushed economic change seems as far from stable as one could think, and collapse seems inevitable unless either drastic measures are taken, or a long steady decline on pace is made."
"You're ignoring Chinese debt. As a % of gdp, Chinese debt is currently 270%! Look at other economies leading up to financial crises: Japan in 1990 hit 200% of gdp before its lost decade; Thailand 190% at start of Asian financial crisis; USA 210% just before the Global Financial Crisis. The Chinese government will acquire most of the debt in its construction industry which will crush government expenditure and economic growth for many years."
Yep
Thoughtful. The wild card is if Covid breaks out uncontrollably. And then there's the Uyghur question. Two variables that are capable of escaping Central Govt control. Only the future will tell.

First time home buyers in china have been eagerly awaiting this property market collapse for 2 decades.
"They won't collapse

They're in bad shape but collapse is kinda too far"
"Agree with what you say on economic stagnation.  
A larger risk is exit of foreign investment or more specifically the acquisition of foreign technology it has brought."
No mention of how much of the average Chinese citizens savings is tied up into real estate?
Everything the west are blaming China for are most likely to happen in the west itself. The collapse of the capitalistic dominion of the world are most likely to happen soon and the socialism will arise as the new world order. Anything else is most unlikely.
You have to admit. The amount of debt in china's housing market is extremely worrisome. That collapse can cause a meltdown easily in itself.
"Two things I disagree with: 

1. With the zero-covid policy, their power as the world's manufacturer is dwindling rapidly, so the so-called monetary independence is quite questionable if you based your logic on that fact. 

2. Central bank can just print out more money and give out the people, yes, but I very much doubt they will do so. why? ever heard of Zimbabwe and the story of 5 kg of cash needed to buy one toilet paper roll? that's probably one of the reasons why they aren't doing it."
How much did the ccp pay you to make this video?
"You just don't think that it will crumble though you've given many reasons why it will.  There was also no mention of the heat wave and drought that is shutting down factories because of no electricity.  China is doomed without exporting.  China's Covid response will hurt their economy far worse than it hit the rest of the World, which was pretty bad.  China's Covid problems are just starting.  They won't be able to feed their population this winter unless they buy a lot of food.  China is facing a perfect storm right now with Covid, drought and an already unstable economy."
"how ever Japan stagnated at a fairly high GDP per capita, china isn't gonna be the same, PRC people will never have the same quality of life as the Japanese"

"Interesting points. I'm not well researched on China's political system. Won't there still be high inflation with increased Government spending in their country? Wouldn't that also exacerbate the problem with the people? Also, how much did the CCP pay you to say this lol."
"Lol, I saw them too but didn't know enough about economics or China to tell how hyperbolic the titles were. How about Turkey too?"
"I watched those videos too and despite their points, I have big doubts if it will lead into total collapse. They are in trouble sure, but saying it will be total ruination is unlikely."
"Thank you for making this video, jesus christ obnoxious"
"the assessment is somewhat right... but the biggest reason why China's economy will not collaspe is that China is the one doing the books and they can fudge all the numbers they want. Chinese government also controls the game. 1) as stated You'll have a hard time getting money out of China because their currency is locked in... most investors realized this now and just won't invest into china because they can't pull their money out even if China collaspe. 2) China's stock market did collaspe at one point and the Chinese government went after short-sellers hard. Basically you'll be in a market where no one can bet against the economy. 3) China economy will not collaspe because it was never ""up"" to begin with.. a lot of Growth is just fudged numbers."
"I mean this proves he didn‚Äôt actually watch all the videos he said he did because one of the videos was actually Laowhy86‚Äôs video on why China WONT collapse and it starts out like a sensationalist piece to bait people that need to hear it

"This is like saying China is invulnerable when their CFOs learnt everything from the west schools. No one is invulnerable especially if US chips act was just signed days ago, factories slowly moving out of china since trump time, even Taiwan chip factories are moving to US recently protecting it from China. China & Russia will not have access to new tech & chips. Countries are  fast becoming more intelligent to avoid China debt traps. China will spiral down, it cant be trusted."
"Show me the money! Unfortunately, the Chinese banks cannot because the money has been sent to overseas investments. Among the locations are Vancouver, Sydney, London, and other outside real estate markets. so the money is no longer in China. And investments in these foreign countries will not appreciate as quickly as the Chinese real estate market. Do you know the words, there is no capital for actually beginning construction on these overdue real estate projects. That will cripple Chinese invesor confidence in banks and other institutions. It‚Äôs hard to get that capital back out of the foreign countries and into China. if you sell a lot of real estate assets all at once, property markets get depressed, and return on your investment will actually evaporate. The money will not come back in a reasonable time to fix the existing Chinese problems, so china will struggle for a long time."
"Dude THANK YOU! I kept seeing these videos and just felt like it was some kind of weird conspiracy just to get people to buy more silver. It is just...so sus.

"""China will avoid an economic collapse by printing money."" Uh-huh. And how is that working in America right now? What about the Ghost cities? The housing market is far worse in China than it was in America in the recession. At least in America the properties were actually built and still there for someone to live in. In China you have 60 million homes that aren't even developed to a livable standard and who knows how many other homes that don't even exist that someone supposedly owns. You are right that the situation is different. You are wrong in saying China will be fine. China is in an even worse place than America has ever been. 3 times the pop, the largest housing market LIE ever built, banks about to print huge amounts of money, foreign business fleeing, the world hates them for Covid and Taiwan, and social unrest brewing. China is a doomed nation and, while I would celebrate the destruction of an evil institution, animals are most dangerous when cornered. It is possible China will invade Taiwan and other nations soon in a desperate bid to get a ""war economy"" going to bail itself out of the nightmare. That worked for America when we got into WW2 and suddenly the depression ended."
I am curious as to how you derived the conclusion that the banks are not in danger of a sudden shortage of capital because the centralized Chinese government can provide it for them.
"Really appreciate this. The clickbait on this was all over my recommended, so it's nice seeing more sober analysis."
Wrong
A war in the Taiwan strait would make China's economy collapse.
"the click bait alarmism is a definite problem. people do that because it sells, or in this case gets clicks.

it depends on what you mean by collapse though. Is like a 10 or 20 percent hit to GDP a collapse?

its not a Sri Lanka style collapse, but it would be pretty wild.

I'm not an expert by any means but given that the real estate sector is 30 percent of china's GDP and also that it has become the primary avenue of investment for Chinese citizens, it seems a lot of wealth stands to be wiped out.

aside from even being able to get your money out of the bank, it sounds like a lot of people's investments are simply going to be gone.

maybe the bigger question is, was that wealth ever there in the first place, or rather was the economic growth ever really there or was it an illusion that suckered a lot of people.

it also seems like this would reverberate through a lot of Chinese industry well. think of all the stuff thats tied up with those kind of massive construction projects, steel, concrete, industrial equipment, millions of employees. 

I don't see the country collapsing, but it seems like it is going to be a sea change kind of disruption.

it is the kind of thing that could cause wide spread unrest, maybe social and maybe even political changes. who knows.

when things are going well, people are willing to over look corruption and the like. when people suffer massive losses and things get tough, they get angry."

He is not mentioning the food shortage issue they will face because the farms can't get seed into their grounds due to covid. Governments can't print wheat.   Also china depends on oil imports worse than the US does which will cause a huge energy shortage in the years to come.

Yes It will you scam.

"Yeah exactly, I agree with you, cause you know I‚Äôve never heard about China about to be collapse. In my whole life I was taught that China‚Äôs economy is very likely never gonna collapse unless if China gets invaded by other countries which war is very unlikely gonna happen."
They should do a video of United States collapse.

It will just fall out of global system as it can‚Äôt evolve because it‚Äôs political system.. You see you are covering Chinas independent monetary system‚Ä¶China has printed double the total money the USA has already . It has 300% debt to gdp. It is an extremely poor country that still gets aid from the world . You are comparing the USA with a third world country that literally has more debt than most countries combined. It has debts on the local side that it cannot pay back but it‚Äôs fine. You have to understand China is terrified of businesses leaving which is happening at an increasing pace. Good luck.  China believes it can avoid a Soviet collapse by tightening security rather than liberalizing . The economic problems are still there. It‚Äôs direct confrontation with its biggest trade partner , the USA is dumb and will be fatal"

"Totally agree, I think they are going in the same path as Japan."
Their internal and economic issues are actually arguements FOR the CCP's continued rule as Xi will use it as an excuse to solidify power and brutally crackdown on dissidents and opponents
"China's economy will most likely face a short recession, until the government fixes the issue. After this, China's economy will continue rising quite quickly and surpass the U.S. Economy, although China won't surpass the U.S. economy as quickly as experts predicted. And the population issue will also be fixed, since China is how focusing on being the top innovator, not only the factory of the world with cheap products as before. China is making much higher qualities these days than before, and surpassed the USA in artificial intelligence, 5G, 6G and even has better military technology in many areas. 

Remember, we are talking about a nation that's more than 5,000 years old (arguably much older) and China has been the largest economy and biggest super power for 90% of human history. That's why you never underestimate China."
I guess the definition of collapse should be discussed.  I would define the American Great Recession as collapse.  I think that is very much in the cards for China.
"China's economy will certainly surpass the U.S. economy. China definitely won't face a Japan style scenario. That is because China is an economic and military super power, while Japan was only an economic super power. The USA managed to intimidate and threaten Japan into submission, which hurt their economy. They can't do the same with China."
What makes you such an expert on China? They chose genocide to balance their economy.
"Whether they are collapsing or not, I would still not invest a penny in that country."
"If things don't change at the CCP's congress, and Xi Jinping consolidates even more power, I think China could be in trouble."

It was bad enough that I started ""do not recommend this channel""ing all of these as it was clear how they lacked credibility. Making such strong claims about foreign (or even domestic) economies is stupid."
I think our definitions of collapse are completely different. When we say collapse we don't mean the country is literally going to fall apart at the seams and it's going to cease to be a nation or turn into a different country. We mean that they're going to suffer a massive sustained loss that they won't be able to recover from for a very long period of time. Basically an L-shaped recovery

Secondly, trapping your money in the country will only discourage investors from banking with the Yaun. Thirdly, Evergreen is not salvageable. Plus, China has population absent cities already. Lastly, even if there is instability in China, the CCP will do everything to hide it. 

Basically, you'll know when you see the explosion from afar. Metaphorically of course. Russia's rubble is worthless. You can back the rubble and yuan with gold all day. But it won't make either of those currencies anymore stable. The U.S. Dollar will remain the world's currency and it's crypto form will assure it's austerity."

Great video.  But you should mention the heat wave.
"I see 2 ways China's economy could somewhat reasonably collapse in the sensational timeframe, but both have very little correlation with China's current banking and housing crisis.

But if the crisis has to do with a pyramid scheme of the housing industry failing. Will China pay off the debt of the banks? And if they do pay the debt and restructure the industry so that people want to invest again won't the housing market still take a huge hit? Let's not forget about the droughts in china and the newly stated bidenomics set to drive the china industrial market down by sponsoring other nations industry. It's sounding like a giant storm coming to China and maybe not the end of China but a huge setback and with china's enormous population number the problems could spiral out of control easily

"With China you never know, since they are a communist regime they can do all sorts of stupid stuff. I would say the most likely scenario is this: Whatever keeps Xi and his communists in power. Everything else is secondary. They don¬¥t give a fuck of the people as long as ""the people"" can non¬¥t endanger their power. So if they see that the people demand those bankers being beheaded then they will do so. They will cripple whatever they deem necessary in order to stay in power."
"I am not sure if demonstrating inequality between the US and China changes anything (arguments at least weak). Any economy can collapse, a centrally planned economy (as shown by the USSR) can also collapse. And of course, other times blah blah blah, anyway, China is China, we don't have access to most statistics, and probably the leaders themselves don't know the real thing, a situation not colored by lower officials. As for the clickbait persuasion, you are confusing the concepts, in these videos they actually show some meaningful (more or less) related arguments. But since that's clickbait for you, your film is 100% clickbait too, you are no different from those foreshadowing the great fall of China."

china wont collapse because chinese peoples money disappeared and govt gives them middle finger.. and what they gonna do?

"Very nice analysis. And one that differs from everything we see. But we cannot ignore that that the power of Chinese economy resides in foreign exchange, this paper money will indeed weaken their economy on a global scale. Also, like everywhere corruption plays a nefarious role and undermines states policies (lowering rates, keeping money in etc) and in some cases (evergrande and other major housing developers ) the money collected is not used to fund projects. Contrary to the 2008 crisis, risk does not sit upon banks and bankers doing sh*it but on the housing development business failing. Also, regarding money ind√©pendance, I‚Äôll use Air quotes. True that since US rating dropped mid 2010‚Äôs China understood that it had to be untethered from US but they are still far from it."
"There is a TOTAL COLLAPSE in the definition of the word COLLAPSE, as used in these videos.

"There will be a war soon, and then all economies will recover.

Because money is always valued more than human lives."
"Good to see a contrarian view, but china‚Äôs economy is still in big trouble. The projected slow down in housing sales is twice as big as the US during the Great Recession, and more significant because housing represents 70% of Chinese investments. And housing developers are way overleveraged, using sales of unbuilt houses to fund current development, resulting in a Ponzi scheme that could see many chinese investors losing their investments.

China‚Äôs population problem is massive. It is the largest country in the world, and simultaneously the fastest shrinking population. There could be 500 million fewer Chinese people in the next 50 years, which is a scale of depopulation which hasn‚Äôt been seen in human history.

China has strong exports currently, but countries have been moving away from China due to increasing labor costs. This has been further accelerated by the covid lockdowns & geopolitical antagonism. Their economy probably won‚Äôt collapse in 28 days, but their decline won‚Äôt be anywhere near as graceful as Japan‚Äôs has been."

what about depopulation
I think i got roped in by a lot of the sensationalist stuff but after thinking about it later i figured if it was as bad as some people make it out to be it would've been bigger news.
I wish china could collapse.
Why are you working for China?
"No one is suggesting that it will become a total collapse.  You failed to mention anything about the amount of people who have invested in real estate that have stopped paying on bad mortgages.  As far as‚Äùthe world needing their products‚Äù is concerned, realignment of supplies to other countries is possible and probable.   China cannot meet its energy needs so factory production will (sooner than later) slow.  We are seeing this, already.  You are not even close on your assessment, but we will know soon."
Wouldn't printing its way out of a crisis be pretty bad aswell? Considering the amount of money that has already been pumped into the Chinese economy to keep it afloat during covid?
True
"After the US provided security for them throughout the world's shipping lanes, this allowed for the incredible rise of China.  They didn't do it alone and for them to come out and threaten the US in the way that they have, it's a great reason to decouple the two economies.   China needs to sell thier products more than we need to buy them.  That will definitely put them on a glide path to stagnation."
"Also lets not forget that China could do everything to shut the protesting citizen up, leave the problem of the citizen not being able to draw money be and let them strave to death. Citizen basically has no power there. When protests appear on social media they will just get censored and erased. So yes I am skeptical that the economy will collapse at all since the goverment hold absolute control over everything. The citizen might suffer but the government will survive. üá®üá≥"
They are going to run into a population collapse which will  significantly impact their economy.
"I am subscribing due to lack of sensationalism and you acknowledge that you don‚Äôt know what will happen, just what might happen."
"Exactly, western people don't understand the craziness of communist. Not a great way for the people, but the government can literally seize anything they want to get money to recover their economy. Now they literally stop anyone from withdrawing money from banks, their system allows them to stop the damage before it gets worst."
"If China reaches the per capita level of Japan before it reaches stagnation, it will have an economy more than twice as big as USA. You like most YouTubers think that only the west has a right to achieve a high standard living. If China achieves just what every other country in east Asia has already achieved, it will be bigger than USA and Europe combined. That is a scary thought. China already leads the world in high quality research and the number of Stem graduates. The other East Asian countries could only depend on exports, China has both exports and a huge domestic market."
"Yes, China can always return to their communist root. Don't forgot who have all the gun."

2017 National Interest : Is China's Economy going to crash ?
2020-2022 bunch of clickbait videos ""china will collapse soon"" makes me laugh so hard 
ü§£ü§£ü§£ ü§£ü§£ü§£ ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"this is why in china only economic expert who can talk about economy on platform like douyin/weibo ,because amateur and missinformation  is dangerous"
"Awesome video, i really enjoyed watching it. Also i agree to everything you said. Thank you for sharing."
i miss Gordon Chang.
"""The Chinese Government values stability more than the US Government"" - shit, that says a lot lol"
That‚Äôs a ca little over simplifies . There‚Äôs a whole lot he‚Äôs not taking into consideration. The us is pulling out . Chinas screwed
this video will not age well
"No no no, it will. just wait."
"Meanwhile on the other side of the Internet wall: US will collapse in 28 days, here's why. *shock face*"
fact number 1 china too damn smart
"I THINK YOU WILL FIND CHINA RELIES ON EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS THE REST OF THE WORLD RELIES ON. AND IF A COUNTRY GOES BANKRUPT SO IT WILL START THE BALL ROLLING, DRAGGING LENDERS CLOSER TO TROUBLE WITH IT. THE NEXT TO GO BANKRUPT WILL CONTINUE THE ROLL, THE NEXT WILL JOIN IN, THEN THE NEXT, THEN THE NEXT. UNTIL EVEN YOUR CHINA GETS ROLLING TOO."
I never really interpreted the collapse to come from chinas economy but more from people faith in the CCP being shattered as more and more Chinese citizens are becoming aware of the CCP‚Äôs failing policy‚Äôs and repetition of the same mistakes.
"Thank you for knocking some sense and exposing lies.
Though the covid lockdowns are horrible in so many ways in China."
How much the CCP pay you to make this video?
Yes. The sensationalist are just propaganda. The divide between nations is just a another global tool of control. Collectivism and individualism are both found in nature and coexist even if they often find conflict.
This video is sponsored by CCP‚Ä¶
"I am smart enough to know that the Chinese economy will not collapse soon. But over time it will, years and possibly decades, but it is only a matter of time. If they are foolish enough to invade Taiwan it will happen much sooner. The real estate market and covid lock downs will slow the economy, everyone tends to agree with that. One of the bigger issues is the one child policy. This will cause an ever shrinking population and an ever aging population.  This means few working age citizens and a aging population that is retired and sicker."
"I think it's important to look at its industrial sectors that aren't directly related to real estate to get a good idea of how bad this will get for China. Agriculture and energy namely. These two things will likely be the root cause of a collapse as China is a net importer of oil and foodstuff, specifically grain and fertilizer. There are likely to be continued disruptions to energy as the ukraine war continues and Russian refineries begin to collapse from maintenance issues. Food is even worse since both Russia and Ukraine are sizable chunks of the global market. But who knows? Things could swing wildly."
The west hates China so badly. It‚Äôs hilarious!
"china will perform better than Japan, because of one simple reasonÔºå China is still relatively poor and inefficiencies within it's economy still prevalent. It sounds anti intuitive but it's the poor income and inner inefficiency will provide further growth room in the next 10 years"
the economy collapse videos are a clickbait but one thing is for sure china is entering a Long hard and dark recession. not only because of covid and the huge debt  there are more reasons for that like gov decisions on a few changes for many business ain china
"It will collapse, it is just That if the Chinese collapse it will create a domino effect"
"Well, it all depends on how China manages that. Real-estate loan positive loop and growing bubble is nothing new today and so far, Japan did the best to get out of situation, if actually call this ""a get out"" and not an infinite lesson of humility. This loop provides so much short-term gain that its really seducing everybody. Like ""we climb now and when everything crushes under us we will manage from stronger wealthier position."" Brave, but maybe not so smart, tbh.
If China abandons its fetish of GDP grows and actually starts to keep up balancing restrictions to slow down real-estate sector and balance it with actual growth doing 0-0 as Japan did, it will be ""a lost decade"" but China will manage well this even better than Japan, bcs their export is Massive. Though, you can't just throw money into local banks black hole and say ""its fine"". Money is NOT infinite. So its way better to take direct control over local banks managing issues with their clients to assure that their savings are actually safe and avoid domino effect on casual level and from other hand slapping local managers Hard and actually making loan interest percent HIGHER, not LOWER to favour more slowing down of crediting. If it will make construction and real-estate companies like Evergrande fail, it has to be done, but to soften this crush, some retaking assets company should be prepared, at least asquiring assets at their real price, likely having loans bust due to...like, say you have 10M worth building built on loan which you hope to sell for 15M so 5M net profit or 50% profit investment. Actual real price of this building is 100k due to actually virtually nobody wants to buy it. 9,9M net loss is hidden till the moment you bankrupt. Then investor, your fellow bank, has,11,9M net loss due to it gives you money with 20% interest. This loss punches hard actual state budget due to, well, when bank bankrupts, commoners giving their money to this bank are at loss and you can't upsetting your fellow voters, so have to refinance this loss. Otherwise, buying power is in vain, local businesses are in vain. economy in vain. But if you don't do this and my little nasty building company is kicking I get more and more of such ""extremely profitable"" projects. From macroeconomy managers, so from government perspective, this ""cancer circuit"" has to be shot down asap if it cares about saving their economy. So, check how big punch you can withstand, grit your teeth, bcs it will feel like stopping a train with bare hands, and start building up interest percent at central bank, looking how fast things start going out of control and ineffective managers at banks and real-estate along with greedy but not really smart landlords start burn like butterflies in raging bonefire. And it has to be done this way, because, say, just restricting loans to real-estate companies won't  save from not really smart bank managers from dubious venturing or greedy landlors from acquiring houses for landing and landing to people who will never pay in the end.   If you start running out of steam and shatter then stop this cleansing and have some air, before returning to absolutely needed evil. This will likely put economy into stagnation if not recession, but this is absolutely needed evil, bcs otherwise, inefficient investing eventually will lead to surge of bankrupting and not returned money, so bankrupt you, independtly on how big are you. Doing so as good as just burn your money or making people, for example dig a hole and than fill the same hole and pay for that.From other hand, China is quite lenient in busting situation before it goes out of control along with loaning more along with giving credits for quite dubious projects with quite dubious perspectives (like Sri Lanka's Lotus tower) what highly likely will lead from Chinese credit surge to unpaid debt and asquiring usless property abroad surge, so the same issue on international scale. And lowering interest percentage in this situation is like make train you need to stop go faster. Yes, when it goes out of rails it will fly for longer, but when it touches ground (market collapses) crush will be much harder.

Likely, China likes to learn hard way tbh. Yes, China is massive, but its absolutely possible to make a train wreck out of everything. Bigger size changes just scale, but not how things work.
Other way still available for China, actually restrict loans to real-estate for example by putting interest for them higher and making sector deflate and lower interest for some short petiod to save local banks. Ok, local bank managers are brainless if not corrupt to bones but that's ok, party is thinking for them. Though, likely, this won't help with real troublemakers and having lower interest they will seek dubious investments even more, bcs they can justify them from economic perspective.Yes, we know about real-estate issue, but chinese one is particular, its not just about greedy landlords squeezing poor renting souls out of last penny, its about corruption schemes between banks and real-estate companies building things nobody really need and creating a bubble out of real-estate company, covering one loan by another justifying new loan by assets built on old loan while their price on paper is quite dubious and making banks close their eyes on other loans somehow. Its similar sector but not similar issue. Issue there, that those nasty little bankers feel backed by government and think they can be a lil bit naughty. That has to be stopped before its gone too far."
You are not examining your logic completely.  You just said draconian covid lockdowns hurt consumer spending.  But you are forgetting it's hurting manufacturing production and export more.  You know how many factories have gone bust and closed their doors in coastal provinces? That would damage the monetary independence you just argued for. So China cannot spend its way out of this by using stimulus alone.
"Due to fractional banking, it only takes 10% of loans to go bad for China to go bankrupt.   With so many large developers going under and 30% of housing projects stalled, it's bound to collapse.  Also the biggest debts are owed by local govt.  And the local govts aren't getting revenue because the new housing isn't being built.  The ccp can't bail all that out.

Russia has about 19 months of reserves before the belly up.  But that depends on how expensive the Ukraine war gets.

The convolution kernal used to model these economies  is devolving towards negative stability."
"I agree with you
Lived in China for 9 years and I can say for sure that the economy is going into a downfall but it's not as extreme as some YouTubers claim it to be and China would bounce back as the government is trying to bring even the smallest enterprises under it's wings and has the capability to do so 
So I think a short term recession might be possible but a total downfall or depression or economy crack is unlikely"
"If y‚Äôall think China‚Äôs economy is gonna collapse, lemme ask y‚Äôall a question‚Ä¶ since 74 years in power, has North Korea collapsed?"
I *WANT* China to collapse. We all do. Return to Democracy is NEEDED
"I guess China will never annex Taiwan then, if it values stability ?"
"Thing is, 99% of China related content being pushed out are all made with a geopolitical agenda 

These days, if you try to make your voice heard but aren't critical of China, you pretty much immediately get labelled as a communist shill"
I really like your videos cause you‚Äôre very objective.
"Thank you for commentating this out. Every single clickbait channel is saying ""lIkE tHiS vIdEo cUz oF cHinA bOtS"". They're saying it's gonna collapse in 20 days. No. It has many countries that can be supported, such as the US and Russia"
"Not one for hysteria but if anyone thinks we're not about to witness a global financial armegeddon then I've got some news for you - you haven't been paying attention.

China is the catalyst whale that's going to set off nuclear dominoes in the global monetary system."
America keeps projecting its problems onto rival nations.  Leader with failing health.  Check.  Rough economic timez.  Check
But you‚Äôre missing the rail bubble and the fact that businesses are shutting down many of many businesses because of drought causing damage to agriculture industry in combination with a energy shortage. All pillars that can lead to a house of cards collapsing.
"Why are you comparing shri lanka to china? How is that even a comparison...

Also you are creating a clickbait title by bashing on other people who do the same just on the other end of the spectrum.

Your statement about china not collapsing is about as foundational as the people who say it will collapse in 30 days."
"I like your analysis. It's just a bit more objective than the 'rest'. ;)
Keep the severe drought in China in mind, as well. ;)"
i am glad this popped up on my feed. its good to hear both sides of an argument as to not get caught in an echo chamber
"If being locked up in your house to starve to death so that you don't get a weaker, watered down virus, and not being able to take your money with you is ""stability"", then even the Jews in Auschwitz had ""stability"""
"Chinese collapsed is sound more like an US narrative than a real event.
Since the 90s the West said the same things and nothing happened. In fact it only driving China more richer and stronger."
"Wow, I am cant believe someone can still talk like that. I hope anything out of this comes out true."
"Bruh people like Gordon Chang have been predicting the impending collapse of China for like more than 20 years now

They're still going to be at it 20 years from now"
The entire first 5:10 of the video is a waste of your time. You're welcome.
"""why won't china's economy collapse?""

""because let me first tell you something about USA that you've heard a million times before. Then here is also some info about morning brew... Here's some more info about USA that you already knew. Now here's some info why China looks to be in a worse position than USA, so... Now here's something about Sri Lanka...""

DUDE.... answer the fking question.
The entire video was so fking annoying to watch."
I'm not convinced with this video
"I hate the ccp as much as the next guy but every time he posts a video I say ""this is the nth time China has fallen"""
"Stoic Finacial has lots of great videos describing why he is incorrect in his idea that Chinas economy is set up and will respond to this collapse like the USA.  https://youtu.be/jftURbd-6Rg  Makes a lot more sense not trying to compare China's collapse to any in western countries, because the CCP owns all the land and doesn't sell it to property developers, just leases it.  Many of the investment properties in China aren't livable and thus, completely different from the housing and property markets virtually anywhere else.  Also why there is no way for it to go for them but down sadly"
"the problem here is that the central bank can't just ""give everyone their money"" to avoid a bank run and crash- they practice fractional reserve banking too, and they don't have the money all in one place to throw around and fix everything. the only realistic measure they *do* have to prevent a crippling bank run is just banning people from withdrawing money. unsurprisingly, they've already started doing this, but the downside of such a move is that it absolutely torpedoes banking and investor confidence, from both domestic and international sources.

let's not forget here, the PRC is not japan. they haven't escaped the middle income trap yet, and their economy is heavily reliant on enormous amounts of investment to keep it going. with their severe demographic crisis, extremely corrupt government, low international standing and reliance on exporting to the west to keep their economy afloat, a stagnated china would be more akin to a giant russia than a giant japan."

"what those channels get wrong, is that an economy (in general) might collapse, but it doesn't happen in the blink of an eye, which some of these channels are claiming that it would, it usually takes years, if not decades for it to materialize. But things can change very quickly and things may devolve faster than we expect."
"The argument of the ''money independence'' of China is really dumb... China is by far the most dependent nation on Earth. Manufacturing is exportable, case in point, China is where manufacturing was exported to for years. Most of it can and likely will be exported elsewhere in a very short term. That's literally what capital flight is. Capital investments typically serves to spend on productive and other unproductive assets, if you remove the investment from productive assets (like what is currently happening because of China's lockdowns and overall long term political aggressiveness against Taiwan), then you just remove the entire reason China is developped in the first place. As opposed to the US, China also imports most of its energy and a lot of its food and is also very low in water security. If you remove it's international trade because either they get too aggressive against Taiwan or because of the lockdowns or even because they are having an unstable economic environment, it really has nothing to stand on. China can't print money like the US does because they may end up inflating their currency so high that their imports will be too costly to buy and that would not only kill their economy but also cause famines. That's not going to happen.

You are right to say China is not the USA... Their case is much worse than the USA during the Great Depression. Most of their savings is tied to real estate, which is crumbling violently with little hope to come back for at least a decade. Most of their economic value is derived from exports which are shaky at best under the current geopolitical climate and under their lockdowns preventing them from producing goods or shipping them. They have little to no security with the most basic goods like food and energy. Their demography is terminal at best, China has run out of consumers at their peak spending years to buy goods or even produce them. Even the US did not have to use tanks in their own streets to calm people down during the Great Depression."
Those 2x days were good clickbait.
Yeah. People want sensational garbage.
There‚Äôs gotta be some CCP bots in this chat each comment is 3 sentences üòÇ
Tik tok ad on this video.  Tells me all I need to know
Chinese Communist propaganda at its finest.
"I'm so used to Western and Indian press continuously prophesising gloom and doom.
I think it was Brian Beletic who said ""China's population is the size of the US PLUS another BILLION. ..""
That kind of puts things into perspective.
The economy is very large almost continental in scale."
üëçüëçüëç agreed with your video.
"Exactly, after reading the book The book The deficit myth, I think what you are describing is a classic case of how MMT works for sovereign nations.
FYI
I think you are deadon with your theory."
"Intuitively, all of those titles just seem super clickbaity / ""this sounds unlikely,"" even if you know nothing of China or economics."
"I appreciate this video.
I've seen a lot of the videos you mention in my feed after trying to get answers on whatever happened to Evergrande
They're all pretty sensational."
When china  falls uhh‚Ä¶ I guess I was wrong  they were right
!remindme 8 months
The specter of China collapsing is as real as the US collapsing. They are TBTF & that also includes India & Russia. China collapse wishful thinkers have been so busy spinning China's demise they are oblivious to what's really going on around them. China's numerous spectacular collapses of the past 3 decades has led to its GDP surpassing the US in PPP terms. Heh.
"To be very tongue in cheek, I don't think it's a 28 days countdown. It's probably a 28 month countdown.

China has a massice trade surplus, for now. But, years from now, it won't. Precisely because the CCP has outed itself as an incredibly unreliable and spiteful regulator and trading partner.

See, the magic juice of Chinese manufacturing was that, it had low enough wages but highly educated enough workforce to make almost anything at any scale, and the things too complex for them to make, wasn't mass market items anyways. But even that edge has been lost. 

Bottom of the barrel manufacturing has moved elsewhere for half a decade now, and even moderately complex, fast moving consumer electronics are 1: realistically competitively finish-manufactured elsewhere like Vietnam or India, yet 2: also advanced enough to raise security and defense concerns. 

Accordingly, manufacturing outsourcing of all complexity levels are more or less leaving China, and this trend isn't stopping. China is losing much of its cost-effectiveness advantage, and what margin remains are obliterated by a combination of CCP volatility and spite, and defense/security concerns regarding dual-use applicability. 

The TL;DR most strategically relevant nations (read: neutral middle powers and MNNA nations) are taking away is that you don't want to trade with an unreliable and spiteful trade partner who might just ape your shit and use it to steal your state secrets, or create the things meant to help China bomb the shit out of you"
Every YouTube channel posting China collapse videos at the same time seemed like obvious propaganda campaign.
"Yes they are. They will not become a superpower. They don't have demographics as they are losing people and their debt is expanding. That does not sound like a country bound for great things.They don't have a source of oil. They can't grow enough food to feed their own people. Saying they will be fine or are better off than the US is trash. only a few countries will do fine. USA is not one of them. The US is facing too many internal problems. Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE are going to be the best off."
"Those videos go viral on schadenfreude, not realising enough that a Chinese crash would bring the whole global economy toppling. On a related note, we can count ourselves lucky Japan chose to let its public debt rise to 250% of GDP over the last 20 years, rather than allowing a globe-toppling crash. But still - East Asia's population implosion is going to happen, at some point in the 2030s-40s, and surely it's an insurmountable problem for the global economy."
"5:25 you claim ""china's central bank can just distribute more"" buuuuuuuut you neglected to mention the ramifications that ultimately come with such action. I disagree with your video, and your analysis. ""I think the Crisis will not be as severe as the U.S.'s great recession because they popped their own bubble"". You're also neglecting to mention that the average American has about 30% of their portfolio tied into real estate, meanwhile the average Chinese has a whopping 80%. Their exposure is much, MUCH, greater. I guess we'll see who's school of thought is correct in the coming months, but it's unquestionable that your analysis is flawed, or at the very least incomplete."
you make other economists look amateurs.
"Thank you for a safe haven from sensationalism. I don't think a complete collapse is likely either. I am no expert, but the worst case scenario is unlikely."
"normal human being's standard : China's economy is collapsing.
China's standard : we're allowed to lower the standard when we reach it."
"The sky is falling, the sky is falling"
"no big deal, before year 1949, china had had nothing."
"As much as I dont like china, but I dont think it will allow itself to collapse. Recession? Ya probably.. but not collapse."
"They're living in debt. Their bond have no value. Their credit rating is poor. They can isolate their currency to stay ""monetary independence,"" but it will not stop inflation in long run. Locking people to stop spending is useless, when these people don't have money to spend. The bank already scammed their people's deposit. You seems to forget individual fat CEO's pigs, who suck the money dry from people, own overseas private properties worth billion dollars of China's yuan. These money is gone forever."
"After seeing your videos, based in my experience in PR for governments this is propaganda"
"How many Chinese are dying today,  from POISON water?  How many Chinese companies have gone on the Swiss stock exchange?. CUT THE CRAP, REPORT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING."
Lol this video was approved by china.
"I'm basically an amateur with economy but I personally think the most likely scenario is that China will fall very hard, definitely harder than what you explained in the video. Mostly because I personally don't believe that when more and bigger problems start to unfold within the country there will be even more protest and fights between people and because of that Chinese government will focus on retaining political control which they will because they're very good at manipulation and in result of that they won't have time to take care of the actual problem for the people which will result in not nessecarily collapse but definitely a depresion.
peace"
finally someone who isnt trying to bs the china situation. i was getting tired of those youtube channels spelling doom for china when china has such a iron fist on their economy.
"You tubers making content when China's economy will collapse and this channel saying it won't, you are all full of shit."
"The USA debt is denominated in dollars. The government can give itself all the electronic credit it needs to pay the bills. Ever wonder why bloated year after year after year after year defense budget & others/‚Äòdeficit‚Äô spending have yet to sink the USA economy despite decades of predictions it would collapse?You really believe that the USA waits for tax revenue to pay bills? It‚Äôs all a show, folks!"
"we all know that China is not giving out its ""real"" numbers...... their GDP and profit is nowhere near what they publicly state. They are set to collapse"
"I've been seeing these ""China will collapse in X days"" videos for at least five years now. At some point you have to start wondering if its clickbait or cope."
"Wrong! We are already in the government digital currency era. Who really believes the Fed Reserve prints bills & distributes them billions or more paperbacks where needed? What, it uses trucks, planes, airplane carriers? It‚Äôs all electronic credits, folks!"
+5000 social credit
"I also think that China is in deep trouble and headed for a recession. That being said, I had watched a lot of these videos (a couple of which are proposing an interesting analysis, while others are just taking advantage of the buzz and simply copy what the other said), but the titles with a countdown to economic destruction is over the top. If anyone can make economic forecasts with such level of precision, they should waste no time making Youtube videos and play the stock market instead!
Your more balanced and less sensationalist approach is refreshing. Thank you."
"China will collapse.
There I said it time will tell who is right.
I will be back to say I told you so."
We should ship all our homeless to China to occupy those condos.
"China is prompted up by the US. It is up to the US that will determine if it will fall and everyone saying otherwise is a blatant fool. America will decide its fate and America doesn't like being in a system without an obvious adversary, because it will turn political focus more internal which Joe Biden has said he doesn't want. Therefore, China will not fall. At least, not until Russia falls first.

If Russia falls, there will be total chaos in the scramble of how to manage that situation. This could be too much for the U.S. given Russia's size for it to also be invested in China and other places at the same time. It will have to give something up. It cannot give up the Americas, because it owns the Americas and doesn't want Europe (especially the UK) back in there. This is part of the secret hostility between the CIA and MI6 that no one knows about. But since I am married to an extraterrestrial Empress who knows what they are doing at all times and thinking at all times, nothing will get pass me. 

America doesn't want to give up Africa, because Africa will become the next major world factor in geopolitics. 

So what else can it give up? It cannot be Europe, because of our culture and history and Russia is part of Europe.

It cannot keep hold of everything, because it is already too inflated with its budget. Something has to give and what is going to give is China. 

It is going to be either China or West Asia. Those are the two weakest and less beneficial subjects of American interest. And as much as America loves making China a nemesis. It could just let the Arabs in West Asia unionize and become a major threat since they are economically much more stable than China and we Americans do hate the Saudis. Much easier nemesis than China would be. 

There is already a hatred of Muslims here, tie that with Saudi's anti-Democratic activities and what they are doing in Yemen. 

The only thing that would stop this is their close ties with Israel. Israel would have to lose or be so integrated with the Saudis that America is turning against the Jews. We are sort of doing this through Christian Nationalism. So it is a possibility.

What I think is going to happen is some sort of compromise will be made with Christian Nationalists who are going to take over the Republican party in the wake of Trump, which is going to be distancing from Judaism and Israel. This will allow Israel and the Arab States of West Asia to better cement closer ties and form a federation. This federation will be regarded as anti-Democratic given the mistreatment of Houthis and Palestinians. This Federation will replace China as the Big Bad Wolf. 

Since America isn't prompting up China, China will fall. And what leads to this dynamic will be fall of Russia and the need to balance China's growth to keep America officially number 1 with a suitable number 2 that prevents internalized politics. China cannot be that anymore since their greed for Arctic resources will make it untenable.

Right now it seems like Ukraine and Russia have mostly just trenched in the South and East. This is going to change. Right now, Ukraine is testing Russian defenses to find a suitable weakspot while keeping the other areas bottled down as much as possible and force Russia to keep altering its defences until Kherson and later Crimea is taken. There is not much Russia can do since the morale of soldiers is terribly low. They are not willing to hold ground. So they are relying on mercenaries and foreign soldiers to the heavy fighting for them. When Russian anti-Islamic rhetoric becomes prominent for these Syrians, they won't fight for them. Russia with F itself when it tries to integrate Syrian, Chechen and Russian forces. Right now that has not happened, because Russia has segregated these forces but Russia wants its people to be committed, since Ukraine can use that against them and turn unloyal Russians into terrorists. So for Russia to prevent that it has to make its people committed, not just its ethnic non-Christian minorities and countries it has close ties with. They'll try to use those more committed soldiers who are not Christian to make the Christians committed. That is just common sense. You want those who know what they are doing to instill such into those who don't. Putin will not go against this, because it will be seen and it is stupid not use this strategy. But this strategy will be his undoing, because he will fail to understand Russian culture. 

Russians hate non-Christians. They can barely tolerate the Agnostic and Atheist among them and by barely, I mean not at all. 

The non-Christians will realize this as the forces are integrated to try and be more effective in preventing Ukrainians from seizing more lands. It is what will doom them. 

Russia should never had attempting anything in Ukraine. It was stupid. The right play would be to yesman NATO until Russia joined. Kill the people in Russia who are against it rather than those in favor of it until Russia was a member and then tear the organization apart from the inside. That is the smart play. It would lead to Russia dividing NATO into two and havings its Warsaw Pact or something similar like it did in the past.

The non-Christians will pull out before proper discipline and motivation is instilled into the Christian Russians. Thus the still undisciplined and uncommitted Russians will just allow Ukrainians to seize more land. I got this information from a Chechen who was boasting about his commitment for the Russian cause. Once the Russians show their true colors to this currently segregated soldier, he is not going to want to fight. Muslims have too much self-respect to allow indignity to fall upon them. 

Ukraine will gain more land and Russia will turn on itself. It will try to blame the minorities. That is just going to lead to successful independence wars being fought by Chechens and others when they no longer want to be part of Russia. These are the better soldiers. You just throw them under the bus. So then Russia has to blame its own people. They don't want to go to work or pay taxes or do anything. Putin has to rely on mercenaries to be bureaucrats. That ain't going to work. Mercenaries do not like doing work. So no state apparatus and his fellow inner circle will turn on him or each other and it is just going to end Russia. 

Russian people who are intelligent know this. If you ask them how Russia will end, this is what they say. Listen to them."
I smell a CCP shill.

I have been amazed seeing all these videos. I thought that kind of propaganda only came from the other side. Thank you for what seems like a more balanced take on this.
Id agree if the issue didn't also include citizens already paying for a property they will never get built and the government saying they have to continue making those mortgage payments... But then again the government has all the guns so probably no collapse regardless.
"The only thing will collapse is the trust of everybody else in China 

Unless you know big companies want that cheap labour"
Never underestimate the incompetence of the chinese communist party.
"Sorry my friend, but much of what you are saying just equals ""Banks can't fail, so the economy can't fail"". Which, is on surface level, a fallacy. Citizens are not paying back their debts, leaving companies and banks with no money. Banks are no longer giving citizens their money, so now the actual ability to buy is severely diminished. Wonderful the banks have lots of money to hold, but an economy is not based on how much the banks have. You address nothing really of the actual economic strain or indicators, and honestly just sound more like someone trying to be a contrarian than anything factual in the world of global economics or socioeconomics.  It's pretty bland and lacks any true informational material."
"""Just print more money"" -The Weimar Republic (bassicaly democratic Germany after World War 1, before Hitler took over) also for the context..... bassicaly when the stock market crashed the Germans coudnt pay theyr debts so they uhhhhh well printed more money.... the countries like Britain and France whcih they owed the debts realised it and said ""we dont accept your money cuz ITS WORTHLESS"" like 1 piece of bread costed 50 000 mark in Germany at that time..... main reason why Hitler took over cuz he resolved the debt and economic crisis"
"Just to be fair, your title is also clickbait as it is provocative and against mainstream opinion."
"Given the steps that the PRC's government has implemented, is the economic hiccup(?) going to dampen their military capabilities if they invade Taiwan? Is it safe to assume that most military hardware used by the People's Liberation Army is manufactured on the mainland?"
So you think the chance of double 6s is different to double 3s? Bad analogy for scenario probability. You unfortunately lost credibility here for your ability to balance the view points and suggest that you know what is more likely to occur.
"I said in another video of the one shown on the first day they posted. Ppl saying how they are PhD and doctors study whole life for this..

I said it will never collapse instead it will grow and become bigger."
So... all those chinese people actually have a real house? Shed lacking a sharp tool.
"I couldn't disagree more. Chinese system will be completely changed in the matter of years. Last few decades of Western hegemony allowed the CCP to grow in strenghts and uplift the entire country. However, this is about to change. The new global order is being applied in the background, while most of the people still listens to mainstream media that present volatile views over a short period of time. These views have nothing to do with reality, they are viral, but not important and nobody will remember it 10 years. China has skipped the industrial steps that the West grinded down in order to rule the world. In practice, hi-tech in China is non existant. China lacks the time to grow echelons of hi-tech engineers. In just two decades the Middle Kingdom population will shrink by almost half, while America will incorporate hunrdeds of thousands of migrants. Same for Europe. And that's about it. We could now talk about geopolitics, which is a killer for China, always was. And we could talk about the culture - the famous Chinese culture that in my opinion has been washed down to a state of a zombie culture."

"As someone who has studied Chinese economics, social aspects, culture, politics, and military in more depth than I care to admit...this video gets a 5 out of 10. Like....yeahhhh maybbbeee the banks will do what you say, or maybe people will keep rioting as they have been doing for months because their money is worth nothing now. Hell, there are literal mini-revolutions popping up everywhere and only recently have added monetary issues to their cause! Who knows, maybe if everything goes perfectly they will be fine, but let's not forget Chinese history tells us that every couple hundred years they collapse in on themselves and turn into something totally different."
"i commented ""29 days left?"" in one of the videos you mentioned"
"Of course Chinas economy is collapsing, I was there watching in real time as everyone's money was de-materializing  and huge voids in space time were eating up unfinished properties and scam investment banks with everyone's money still in it. Xi Xinping said on national TV ""ÊàëÁöÑÈò¥ËåéÂ§™Â∞è‰∫Ü"" and it really demonstrates the severity of the situation. Glory to the Peoples Democratic Socialist Union of the Proletariat Soviets Republic of China, one they they will reintegrate the rebels in Taiwan by physically moving the island to connect to the mainland then we will all have world peace"

Very good video. I saw one good video about the problem that China had and then I started getting bombarded with those sensational thumbnails about the economy collapsing
Lol
"""üòÜ china will not  Collapse.""
Only somebody that supports this  Communist garbage would say something like that, and it will collapse if things continue on the way they are."
"As someone who wades in the amateur Chinese accounts, China is collapsing hard . It‚Äôs crashing very hard and you don‚Äôt actually look at those sources"
"China's economy will be impacted in the short term, but it will not collapse. It needs to be added that if China's economy collapses, the world economy will collapse, and the third world war will follow."
"This was a nice balance to the plethora of ""China is on Fire!"" videos.  Thanks for taking the time to lay this out rationally."
The spam of videos about China's collapse really looks like propaganda...
Even if it does collapse you will never find out due to tight media control
"I disagree on several points, starting with the thought that the US government just let the banking system collapse just to teach bankers a lesson. That is completely ignorant of all the destructive economic actions taken by Hoover and Roosevelt that turned a depression into the Great Depression.

You assertion that what Russia did with the Rubel is also increasingly short sighted. Russia can't open its monetary system back up, else the Rubel will suffer such a great collapse that all Russian banks will be under threat of going under. It's a desperation play that China is having to follow."
"You  lack any understanding of the china problem.

You have no idea how they manipulate the numbers
Did you ever think about why The corps won't reveal their full financial informations?

If you did stayed at china for years
You would know how communist reach the extreme stats

"The 28 days or whatever yeah is BS but the situation is very real. They have been kicking the can down the road for YEARS. And sure maybe they can kick it for a few more years but that's what people don't realize is that the government itself has been making it WORSE not better. They are the ones making the bubble even worse trying to artificially inflate their GDP. Now that they are trying to stop that it really IS collapsing. So sure they can keep going more than 29 days they can use their super market control powers to kick the can even further down the road but it's only making the bubble worse. And it makes our 2008 problem look like a walk in the park. Regardless how long they can prolong it the situation is very real, and much worse than anything we could even dream of in the West. So sure the sensationalism of the titles is misleading but what is eventually going to go down is very, very real and going to be unlike this world has seen in a very long time."
Thank you I‚Äôm a huge fan of Chinese politics and all this China will collapse nonsense is stupid it might hurt/slow down their economy for a few years but it definitely isn‚Äôt gonna make them collapse
Dear Money and Macro. What do you think on the Yale university investigation on Russia's economy after the sanctions and do you think they simply are overhyping the problems that Russia has faced since 2014 for media purposes
"China has Massive problems in
Real-estate there Demographics and with the nonsensical Covid-19 Lockdowns. 
The worst of those is their Demographics.
No easy fix for that."
I think when people said collapse they not referring to scenario like sri lanka.
"let's just say those other youtubers basically have a problem with wetting their bed at night.  believe or not, that sums it up neatly when you think about it."
"But how do you define ""collapse""? I think that's subjective... Chinese people are being locked out of their own money and have been for weeks or even months.. They're pissed off, and now with the power rationing that's taking place, major cities like Shanghai are experiencing days worth of black outs.. In my opinion, ""collapse"" doesn't mean the economy just up and dies one day and their currency becomes useless... it means people become so fed up with their inept leadership, that they begin rioting, killing politicians and bankers, and essentially strip the Government of it's power.. I think they are far more close to that scenario happening than they are ""going broke"" as some of those sensationalist YouTubers are saying will happen within 30 days."
Chinese thing never long last!! That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called Chinese
"I think your wrong mate. 
catastrophic disaster waiting to happen! but most likely the Chinese government will put billions or  trillions for it to keep a float so maybe nothing will happen who knows."
"Considering how wrong you were on inflation while you hade the same ""i know best"" attitude l take this a sign that the Chinese economy is collapsing soon. Not saying the country will collapse, the CCP is prepared to do anything to stop that happening. But their real gdp and trade balance will take a massive hit"
That was a pretty nice video
"This is wrong 1) I don't believe China has the funds to rescue this situation. 2) You say that China intervened sooner, and therefore China is in a better situation... as I understand it, that simply is not true, the situation had already got considerably more out of control than the West when the Chinese public invest so heavily in property, even to the extent of buying before the property has even commenced being built. 3) I agree with your last point... in re one child policy, and Covid.

I just hope and believe this will lead the people of China getting the democracy they deserve!"

Your analysis is the most accurate of the situation on china !

"I hate all of these Chinese economy vids, its always blasting china and honestly feels like major propaganda"
That you put an idiot mask on the Russian caricature tells me all I need to know about your views.
Thumbs down for supporting China üá®üá≥
Depends how much EU and USA capitalize on their internal issues
then why are people lining up to not get there cash?  lies
"question, would the Chinese gov cause inflation by suppling the funds needed to bailout ? no money leaves the country yet has more of it , wouldn't it basically restart the issue in the long run?"
The Chinese government can just park polices in front of the banks so no one is allowed to get in to rush it
"While this video was neccessary to debunk the sensationalist ""China is collapsing"" videos, on the ground the Chinese has big problems. Large parts of the job market are almost dead, layoffs relative to hires in the private sector is immensely high and people on the street are simply very very worried. 
This is not yet a full recession, most of the services sector is doing fine, BUT the most productive industries are suffering. The government is trying to cope in a number of ways, from blowing up the numbers of public servants to monetary easing and a new round of export subsidies (mostly through financing export industry with disregard of risk). 
As mentioned in the end of the video, experience says that this spells the end of productivity growth and could result in an extended period of stagnation. Only a few highly competitive industries will be able to grow, but those are most vulnerable by sanctions should the politic climate get worse.
My fear is the Xi JinPing may take desperate measures (5+ years down the line) when all those interventions will have lost their effect. We live in interesting times."
"ummmm... you need to review your info on the odds of rolling doubles with a pair of dice. You totally blew that, along with any credence I give to this video."
"You're right, they are different.  The property sector and banking sector are rife with corruption and poor decision making, not just poor decision making.  Each operated like a Ponzi scheme.  Additionally, most chinese wealth is tied up in real estate that just evaporated.  So, everyone that isn't super rich is becoming super poor.  All supply chains have been leaving China for years, since the start of wolf-warrior diplomacy.  They have so many problems coming to a head it's insurmountable.  Will the CCP ""collapse""?  Depends on what you mean by it.  Is their ponzi scheme world power over?  Almost certainly.  Paper tiger for sure."
"6:05 ""China values stability more than the U.S. gov't, so I suspect it'll try to spend its way out more forcefully"" ...I'm sorry I don't really care that you have a doctorate, you're not taking China's rampant imperialism and faux Communism into consideration when assessing how they wordsmith to further control the already-agitated masses. Xi will say _anything_ - both to his people *and* on the world stage - and it not be *remotely* in reality.  Meanwhile he's overextending his country's assets all over the place _already_ to bail out other countries DURING all of these multi-billion-dollar bank & real-estate-group scandals!  Not to mention that China needs the U.S. _wayyyyyyy_ more now than the opposite, particularly since the U.S. seems willing to protect their semi-conductor interests in Taiwan so Pelosi's husband can do more insider trading.

Chinese corps and the gov't are _rife_ with corruption at every level, _MUCH_ like the U.S.  Sure China's ""different"", but they're merely further along in their fascism than the U.S. and the avg. Chinese citizen is *correct* to watch their personal _and_ corporate-treasury pursetrings very closely now, despite near direct orders from the CCP to ""buy a flat if they have the money to do so"". 

You need a healthy dose of Peter Zeihan in order to understand how the *systemic* failings will lead to the fall of the current regime if they don't change course at several fundamental levels.  And they won't, 'cause Xi's merely interested in forcing himself into a 3rd term like the autocrat he's become."
Now this video is a greater clickbait! üëçüëç
"I 100% agree. However I think the analysis doesn't need to be at all complex. China's economy won't collapse because the CCP won't allow it to. 

At worst parts of the economy will regress into a command economy. So long as it doesn't affect export deliveries no amount of pain and sacrifice will be too much to keep the economy running. 

Bank failures? Well at a pinch simply tell your citizens that the state will sort it out and then make them wait until it suits the state to pay up.
Building developers failing. Call it fraud and execute a few hundred of them - then tell your people to 'wait for their money back or goi and live with the Uyghurs and see how you like it'.

Political strife - well, citizens are free to protest and express their views (if they want to spend a few years in the camps - see hongkong)

No economic problem is insurmountable if you are an all powerful life president of a police state that has been implementing absolute social control for decades. Controlling thought and deed since the cultural revolution and one-child female-infanticide horror. Look at North Korea, it has no economic problems.... well no one is talking about any.

China's economy will only fail the day they can't make and export stuff. It barely matters what China's internal economy looks like, or how many people are robbed by bank collapses, who starves, who goes to the camps, so long as those exports keep supporting the People's Army. I'm not even saying that is immoral, I'm just saying that's how it is."
This guy looks Chinese and seems like he was born there.....  Dont pay attention to videos like this
"Didn't really get the dice analogy as all combinations are statistically just as likely to happen, but great video otherwise."
"Listen man. I‚Äôd rather have hope that China may collapse than some dude talking about it not. Its a prediction. Plus, absolutely no one cares about China or what your talking about it. Sure its good if it collapses. Because they are Communists. They deserve it. Its possible you could be payed by Chinese to deliver fake news. Like they have done before. So even if your correct. I don‚Äôt care."
Why didnt you address the rail system as well?
"this is just what Western media is trowing out to all these ""youtubers"" like they said Russia would go bankrupt in 2 months after the war began.. its pure Western propaganda to keep citizens calm.. when the winter is coming and people cant afford food, heat and electricity, they will turn on the goverments.. and China is there to buy most of the companies who go bankrupt.. dont forget China own most of USA and ALOT around the world."
1.China paid for this content huh?
"Thank you for this video, an answer to all this clickbait stuff was very much needed!"
"Japan style stagnation is most likely because if you go to Japan you will see that the Japanese are still employed, busy buying stuff and the streets are still kept clean. Consequently Japanese are not rioting in the streets. The BOJ buying up the govt debt is a small price to pay for full employment and social stability. This is what the Chinese care most about and not about philosophical debates about moral hazard. Thanks for your video! üôÇ"
Drop in the ocean. Chinas Wealth.
"I generally agree. This still puts China in a weak place economically for a few years. I wonder how that plays into their interactions with the United States, Japan, Russia, and Taiwan."
"Um, yes, it will. The debt is increasing, the inflation is causing chaos and revolt."
Enjoyed the video however one small criticism and that is your microphone.
i tought as well this sensational youtubers are kinda cringe

"Thank you for making this video, Im so pissed off by all these videos poppig up claiming Chinas collapse is just around the corner. Though this isnt really new since many pseudo-economists have been spouting nonsense like that for the past few decades its still kind of crazy what stupid comments are made in these videos, my favorite example: ""China is now painfully realising the shortcomings of their socialist system as it simply isnt designed to withstand these sorts of crisis"" (unlike our oh so great western free market systems). Funniest thing about it is that neither does China have a socialist economy nor was there anything remotely socialist about the parts of their economy that are currently facing problems, quite the opposite actually with the private businesses, speculation and fraudulent banks..."
"You name your vid in name of very limited and definite conclusion and hereinafter disclaim that conclusion it.... are you sure you make POV towards China situation clearer? A lot of things you say are just presumption (even not based on facts) about behavior of insane Chinese politics who live in self-made bubble of nearly unlimited power and ideological self-scam....
In regards to China all we know that there is nothing giving acurate overview of current situation and prediction of it's development because China is jail totalitarian regime that performs what wants to be seen & believed meanwhile hides what's inside and beyond the veil of propaganda....
If you, instead of performing doubtful thesis, create clear overview backed with real data creating logical facts based on specific calculations I would find it as something considerable instead of thinking ""OK, this guy has different opinion....so...let further reality show who was right..."""
Lol so many China stans
"is Chinese economy collapse? NO But, is the economy starting to deteriorate? Yes Is the Chinese economy sustainable in this trend? NO  If you are a recent grad in China, you will have trouble finding a job. The housing crisis, supply chain and drought can be the black swans."
Too much jade to collapse.
"The only falling in china just a property investion because making big ass project withouth thinking the prospect what,when,who,why where and How will buy it more look like cities skyline with mod cheat,

"Please don't take this the wrong way, but your soft voice/accent combination can be hard to hear sometimes.  If you hired a freelance narrator, your channel would grow even more."
I think you forgot to talk to the regular Chinese person on the street. They all know of the corrupt government running their country. All the top members of the CCP have billions of dollars in their individual coffers and they will not care about what happens to the people. The real estate develops owe close to a trillion and have tons of incomplete projects. All homebuyers have to get a loan before construction even begins. So now a boycott on those loans will put a lot of pressure on the banking system. China has a significant reserve and will spend some of it to help out but not a sufficient amount to help out everyone. The real estate bubble will burst which will take down many connected industries and it will create a Great Recession in China. However with its trade surplus it will create a great inflation for the rest of the world. It will happen it‚Äôs just a matter of when. The three red lines made out more difficult for real estate developers to get more money and finish existing projects. China did this because it saw the debt level reach crisis state. China has always reported significant GDP numbers based on local growth and probably inflated them just a little to look better. All this and their weird/dangerous policies may not destroy China but it might revert China back to the 20th century. Yes there are some click bait videos out there but there are a couple that quotes various economists/academicians as well as recognised financial institutions like Bloomberg and S&P.
"I agree and have been saying this for almost a year now to all these Chinese doomsayers.  Instead, Chinas Economy will flourish.  This is why, Europes economy is on the verge of collapse.  The dollar is high but the Chinese dollar is not.  All of Europes buying power will go from the USA to China, remarkably boosting China‚Äôs production/GDP.  This will cause stagflation to happen in the USA for which Americans will then do the same and buy cheap Chinese products in substitute for everything else.   Xi is just to hard on AliBaba but I think he will start going easy on tech companies.  So whats the deal on the Covid zero policy in China? Why??? Do they know something on the later after effects of Covid infection that the World doesn‚Äôt know.  China studied Covid in detail at the Wuhan viral institute as its their Virus.  Will the world go demented with the after affects of covid, in 10 years from now? I hope not."
Grifter.
"Good video. A little more about the stability of the Chinese political system would be a good thing since your argument relies heavily on its continued functioning. Energy and food prices, both extremely dependent on imported inputs, are also something not considered. Overall, I agree that the matter of fact tone given to claims of total collapse are counterproductive."
Sounds like what a CCP bot would say. The CCP paid this guy off for sure.
Oh how wrong you both are...

"Well in a way agree in a way I complete disagree cause

2. The population decline 35 years of the one-child policy where female children had less worth - 10-15 y from now on you have 1/3 of the workforce gone
3. China is completely dependent on imports of food and energy. Good luck to them if they become even more aggressive in their foreign policy 
4. The bubble exists which is not a big of a problem but losing its market more and more and especially cause the production of companies are pulled out of China massively."
"How the heck did you know???!!! That exactly this week I was searching for another countdown video to comment ""So... Really, how long do we have to wait? Again? And again, and again...."" Cause the amount of these videos makes you wonder all together... They should work for television like RT..."
"All those are propaganda videos. If you search you'll find exactly the same videos but for Russia, 6 months ago."
Now everyone is copying serpentza
A genuine question. Why would we believe you and not them?
I think you missed that the Chinese government also has lots of money invested into the collapsing countries (like Sri Lanka)
"Subscribed, I‚Äôm looking different POV from other Ytbers. Great POV and content. Cheers"
"Same thing with Russia, they are doing much better then I think even respected analyst predict"
I hope you are wrong. The CCP needs to go. And the only way it will go other than collapsing under its own stupidity and corruption would be a war.
Thank you for making a video that isn't just wild clickbait. They've been saying China's economy will collapse soon for 20 years.
No surprise. The internet absolutely can't be in agreement on ANYTHING.
China's economy is not good recent months. Customers are losing their confident to spend money. I wish things will get better.

"what i realized from graham stephans channel, that guy is out of ideas and is just clickbaiting."
u.s treasury bonds held by china $18 trillion.  if anything u.s will collapse.
"China will collapse after India replace it to be the next world manufacturing hub. India, the next superpower."
"The Coming Collapse of China is a book by Gordon G. Chang, published in 2001, in which he argued for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to be the root cause of many of the China's problems and would cause the country's collapse in the near future."
Just like north korea people been saying it‚Äôs going to fall any second for years it hasnt though
"Often over looked as to why China will never collapse is the world demand for China‚Äôs product.  China just announced a trade surplus of $100 billion just for the month of July.  That‚Äôs a new record.  China just picked up 150 million new customers for their products, the Russian.  Due to western trade sanctions, the Russian auto manufacturers had to shut down.  Russians and Central Asia are now buying Chinese cars and everything else from China that is used to be supplied by the west."
Good video mate! I also fell for those other videos that were trending haha.
"üí™ Excellent video sir.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Caay18H9QvY&t=6s"
"You know little of the ccp, that‚Äôs what will collapse. And the u know little of 2008, that was caused by the government during Clinton‚Äôs era forcing banks to throw away their risk assessments and loan to poor people, otherwise they would face heavy penalties. Lesson is, the more the government interferes the worst off it will be. However those YouTubers are wrong on the timing.  And most things as well"
"Every day Xi/the CCP continue to shoot their economy in the foot and turn the people against them by keeping them locked up in the name of ""zero covid"" (lol) a collapse becomes more likely. I just don't think it will be a fast one, if it happens (though I think the odds are higher than 1 in 12). I see more of a slow-mo (probably partial) implosion, with severe global impact. As the video says China is free to print as many yuan as they wish, the consequences of which will not be felt overnight, plus they never disclose real figures, and will do everything they can to hide or downplay the looming catastrophe, as always. Also the video claims China has heaps of non-earmarked dollars in its coffers, a statement which I cannot but question. I would like to hear exact official numbers (even if unreliable), not just ""a lot"" (sounds like a ""trust me bro"" statement)."
Angry white and black westerners want China to fail
"You're ignoring the part that their exports require inputs, that they need to purchase. They've subsidized their manufacturing to an absurd degree, china still needs to buy inputs for just about anything. They can't export if no one will sell them coal etc. Chinese manufacturing relies on riding the margins tightly a small bit of shock in input prices and you end up with serious declines in manufacturing."
China collapsing I was unsure about but some serious economic earthquakes definitely but you could say the same for most of the world atm I guess
"Seems like a lot of western ""thinkers"" are desperate for China to implode and just go away somehow which leads to a lot of wishful thinking and sensationalism not to say China's problems aren't real or significant."
"Very interesting video. What I can say is that the ability and intelligence required to run a country of this size are beyond ordinary countries. There is a very deep and complex knowledge about the concept of state governance, that is, Chinese politics, and even its doctorate and countless scholars are studying it. I feel that some youtubers who want to evaluate China's future should at least obtain a Ph.D."
"As a Chinese, I would say: Let's see. You have better conclusion than other brainless China hatre blogs, but still you missed some factors in your analysis, for example, technology revolution, industrial upgrade, economy policy adjustment, government fund infranstructure construction, possibility of unification of the Taiwan island, etc."
"I watched the other videos and just couldn't agree how they just kept comparing the scenario of China with america's one, the failed to grasp how different china's economic system work, yes, it does work like most liberal capitalism systems in the world, big difference is, the government actually has a say in how their investors use the money, China is fully aware of the housing problem, but it also knows it NEED the real estate to develop for ""their greater ambition"" to become the biggest potency, china is ruled not by capitalism, but by their government tight grasp, unlike the us that doesn't see anyone as a threat (while it keeps messing around with other countries to ensure it never happens under the table) China has a clearer goal, and it's willing to sacrifice whatever it's necessary to achieve it even if it has to be upfront about it, just look at the 1 child policy, they will eliminate and correct any threat to they goal, rescue a bank? eliminate activists? shut down corruption? ""incentive"" families to have more kids? they have a heavy control over the population, and by using that power, they will enforce any policy to get back on the rails to the top, which is honestly scary, at one point determination fir a goal becomes an obsession, but do let that fool you, obsession is a very powerful motivation, thry are just facing the consequences of capitalism, they will get oit of there, unless of course, the have really stupid people on charge of the money stuff, then, china's collapse is more plausible."

"I‚Äôve been seeing people (laughably) making similar claims about the U.S., lately."
Now us government is paying youtubers like Chinese paying
"It will collapse the entire developing nation will collapse; some more public than others. It‚Äôs inevitable due to fiat debt currency system.  The question is when and how bad.  When nation change or create a new currency a collapse took place previously.  The only question is when and how bad.  China is government control and highly censorship. So when it happens only little will be heard, it will most be felt especially by the Chinese people. Starvation, murders and others will just increase and the government will censor the information."
paid influencers doing paid anti china videos...who would have thought that the 2nd largest country will not just disappear.
Westerners tend to forget China is communist totalitarian state
Leave it to a Dutchy to sober people up. Bedankt ;)
No no no no no
"From a fellow economist, thank you: hearing a word of reason between the sensationalist chaos is like a breath of fresh air!"
Thank you! ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs economy collapsing‚Äù sounds like something Americans and Europeans WISH were true.
China's oncoming population decline is catastrophic.
"Well, I think China will shrink in the next 2 decades due to societal development and population distribution (main factor age). But the time frame proposed here seems ludacris"
"The truth about China's banking crisis
https://youtu.be/EhYxFnaPgCI"
Most of anti China propaganda is funded by c.i.a.
"Finally, some common sense."
"I think the bigger picture is the fact that the CCP has shown to be incapable of actual stability.
China simply can't endure all of the long-term AND short-term failings of the CCP.

Right now China's most important asset, it's people, are giving up. Businesses are shutting down, a ""let it rot"" philosophy is spreading, and the insistence on Zero Covid has crippled their economy.

Factories can't get workers to do their jobs, and those that can will have to trap their workers in their walls if someone has Covid.

This drives selling prices up, and make external businesses look elsewhere for cheap labor.

I understand the need for realism, but to ignore the multitude of societal and cultural factors in addition to economic is just absurd.

The CCP has been living on borrowed time ever since it adopted Communism instead of actually trying democratic reform.
In doing so, all that happened is that China inherited the evils of the Dynasty era and the ignorance of the Soviet Union."
Dutchie allert!
China is absolutely gonna collapse when they enter conflict with the United States of America and Taiwan their fate will be sealed
"Finally, a YouTuber who is honest - why tf would the country with the 4 largest banks collapse w/o taking everyone else down with them"
that graham stephen guy has such a punchable face
"China isn't Japan! Japan has an extremely stagnant political system unwilling to intervene in the economy, unwilling to accept immigrants to deal with falling birthrates, and without significant international leverage to create trade deals and export capital. China is the opposite, with a dynamic political system accustomed to change, and focused overwhelmingly on the future (the developing world)."
"As a Chinese living in the States, I‚Äôm all used to this kinda of propaganda. According to some ‚Äòexperts‚Äô, China has been on the path to collapsing since 1995"
"Finally someone with common sense 
China will be fine just clickbait"
"Like i said, CIA paid alot of money for those China fud vids. Anti-China forces have been telling us China gonna collapse since the 90¬¥s. This is thier work, Gordon Chang much....They will Gordon Chang(BS) you!!!!!"
The banks are collapsing left rgt and center they have no money
"""They are manipulating currency"" -- to keep the price of their exports low.
China is the manufacturing capital of the WORLD.


How can China's economy possibly collapse.  Maybe it will... but NOT before everyone else's does so first.

We are so dependent of expensive sh*t we don't really need that their country manufactures."
"I don't think anyone think china will crumble. I think everyone is hoping it cracks enough that a lot of stuff is moved away from China who have some very harmful policies to citizens of their country and others. As a global citizen I want everyone to be as safe and happy as possible. China is getting cocky with their power, and pulling a lot of scary moves for the future. A lot of people don't want to see these moves being pulled. So a china that is weaker is good.

Or China's economy starts slumping like Japan and Korea's did. Which it probably will soon, or be quickened by this event."
"For us Chinese, it is called loan upgrade.  There is unlimited supply for money because Chinese is using digital currency exchange.  to waive it, just delete a line of code.  not to mention, the bad debts of the major five banks are about 3% of overall loans.  The price of major city property is high because too many people want to move in and supply is so limited.  there are ghost cities in China too, people move away from it and the price collapses.  There is no leverage bubble at all.  The troubling property developers like  wanda or evergrande account for less than 1/1000%.  the western media only count private developers but completely ignored the public and state side which account for more than 80% of overall developments."
I never click these videos they are so clickbaity
It's very clear you haven't been to China since Coivd and don't know anyone living there right now.
thx for getting things right
The videos did have some relatively interesting info but yea obviously when they say china will fall in x days I don‚Äôt take that part seriously. I get hatred for the Chinese government I mean if you are human you should but I‚Äôm not completely blinded such that I would believe something so ridiculous.
Wow...a breakdown that doesn't just screams WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!...i literally didn't knew that was even in youtube.
"I think it is very clear that China's economy will collapse, as will the of every country, ... but collapse is always a relative thing. It is never a complete collapse, it is just a decrease which depending upon one's point of view can be called a collapse. Now, if the economic decrease causes a civil war and/or a change of government, most people will agree that is a collapse, but even when that happens, like it did with Russia from around 1990 to the end of 1995, civilization did in Russia did continue. I know, half my family lived in Russia during that period.

The USA financial crisis of 2008 was an economic collapse. Not as large a one as the Great Depression, but it was still a collapse. Some people don't want to call it that, because it sounds bad. 

So, what we are really talking about is how big the collapse will be and how destabilizing to other aspects of society. This is a problem the whole world faces, because there are a great many large instabilities which are virtually certain to cause economic collapses, the question will be how big and how disruptive. This can result in China going into a Civil War. This can result in the USA going into a Civil War. This can result in WWIII breaking out. Or it could result in none of these last three possibilities."
Welllll the facts about the real estate crisis is true but they not about fall all the money they putting into Brazil mining a forcing the aborigines of that land out they definitely not on an collapse THEY ARE ACTUALLY EXPANDING they did the same thing in üáØüá≤
"I think there is a chance for revolution in China 
Although I don't know what the chances are I think it depends on how it's people and military 
React 
If the people accepts the situation and don't 
Start to attack or revlt (which pretty big protests has started)
Mixed in with the current situation and the Chinese history I think it's not to farfetched"
I would be incline to believe you but‚Ä¶something doesn‚Äôt feel right.
"OMG - finally, an intelligent voice !!!!!"
"dude
for over 10 years now there's a pretty extensive drive to paint China as broken and evil as it gets
especialy on certain social-media platforms and certain content creators
the funny part beeing that this shit is so patheticaly absurd by now, that no one takes these videos serious"
"*No collapse. Because people are not allowed to say that theyve collapsed.*

*In the West they call it FUD Conspiracy Theories. Bread lines are a figment of the imagination. Looting is not happening. Rainbows are shooting out of assess.*"
"China becoming the manufacturer of the world was due to its low cost labor, and its acceptance of foreign manufacturers to invest in China.  Also, China was accepting of foreigners.  To westerners There was  the expectation that China would become more liberal in its views and actions as they melded with the western world.  This has not happened.  Instead China has invaded the privacy of their citizens by watching them like Big Brother in the novel 1984, and has ruined the good relations with other countries by fondling North Korea, making friends with Russia, Iran, and Pakistan, the antithesis of liberal nations.  Yes, western nations depend on their manufacturing, but the cost in China has now reached parity with the United States.  Why build there when the US can build at home or better,  negotiate manufacturing in Vietnam, or other asian countries that are not building ships, armies and alliances against the west?  

China's economy needs to sell to the world.  The bulk of its GDP consists of exports.  Any drop in that area from the USA or Europe will devastate their economy and their people.  They are also losing workers every day.  Their demographics are a disaster.  Today they have the highest aging population in the world.  It takes 25 years to make a 25 year old worker or soldier and the Chinese aren't making many of them with a very low birth rate that is getting worse as more people move from the rural areas into the cities.  I certainly would not say they will fail in 27 days, but I would say their time near the top of the world economically, is limited.  Anyone thinking otherwise has his or her head in the sand or is not looking at the complete picture."
Print money to get out of trouble sounds like a good idea.
"You've earned a sub!
However, I think you overlook one crucial thing:
Your conclusion is based on the world needing China for manufacturing, but we're seeing the Zero Covid lockdowns are really hurting their production output. 

Western companies are already moving their offshored supply chain parts out of China and to other low-wage countries, and overall over-demand is now being addressed by looking for alternative suppliers - as a result, it's possible that China won't be the massive export giant anymore relatively soon. 

Of course, a lot depends on how long the Zero Covid policy is upheld, how much overdemand drops due to inflation, and how fast other suppliers can be found/built. 
So it may well be that you turn out to be correct!
But I feel like the sand is shifting below our feet, yet you did not address this in the video.
In other words, there's a third scenario that should be included, even if its chances are comparatively small."
"Hi, 
What are the obstacles that prevent China and Russian citizens and companies to pull money out of the country?"
"I personally love how not one single economist has gotten any prediction about China right ever.

It‚Äôs clear that capitalist know nothing about economics. Just a fundamentalist delusional economic belief system.

The days of America and Europe controlling the world are over."
"A lot of people will be very disappointed by this video, China isn't going anywhere, they have massive economic activities in USA, Canada, Australia, Every major economy in Europe and much of Africa and Asia. They even forgo some loans they lent in poor African countries one week ago. I got sick of those Channels claiming China is collapsing.. Almost every single country in the world is going through an economic crisis of their own, well maybe except the oil rich ones in middle East."
China will fail in every way as time continues
Tight control and print money. And they don't have to worry about inflation?
is europe collapse too ?

Sponsored by the CCP
"so in conclusion China is paying debts with debts, a recipe for an imminent collapse (at one point)"
You didn‚Äôt explain their banking problem well enough it‚Äôs worse than just people trying to get their money back
"I think everyone can agree that China is not comparable to any other asian country and that the clickbait titles are definitely exaggerating the situation. However, let's please be careful, as you mentioned China is not the US and the few points you highlighted are definitely true but some were completely omitted or oversimplified. it's true that China's more centralised banking system might be more robust against a market crash and following bank run, but the other side of the coin is that this links banks directly to the fate of the national construction companies like Evergrande that have inflated a housing market bubble worth 3 times the 2008 American one according to the the most conservative estimates. this housing and banks are not only tied through mortgage bonds, in a centralised system the money used by the government to finance all aspects of the country's economy comes in big chunks from the banking system. This is particularly true in China were tax evasion is extremely high and it doesn't guarantee enough revenue to sustain the entire country apparatus. If you sum this to the fact that we don't know how much liquidity the CCP has (especially if you consider that they have financed extremely costly infrastructure, military and international projects in the last few years), I believe that caution should be advised. If the housing market collapses causing a bank run and a general stock market crash for a total damage of several trillion of dollars, it's not granted that the CCP will be able to bail out everything."
"CCP will hurt it's people quite a bit through this, but they won't collapse..."
"How much are u getting paid, wumao?"
"You are delusional, or been paid off by the ccp...Your saying because China doesn't have a republic they can't go into collapse, lol... What about history, 60 million dead by The Great Chinese Famine that was caused by a combination of radical agricultural policies, social pressure, economic mismanagement, and natural disasters such as droughts and floods in farming regions..you are saying that can't happen again, when litterly some of those things are happening right...lmao sell out"
"During the entirety of the Cold War, the prevailing narrative in the West was that the Soviet Union will collapse any day now. Any day. It'll collapse. 

While yes that is true, and it was true, the same can be said for any state. Any day between now and the end of days, America will collapse. Europe will collapse. Russia will collapse. 

But people act like this is something that will happen in the immediate future. It will not. The CCP survived one of the worst famines in Chinese history, a famine it orchestrated through incompetence and deliberate malice. People are expecting a dramatic fall of the CCP, not realizing that the collapse of dynasties in Ancient and Medieval China was a long and protracted process. Taking decades, if not centuries. One economic crisis was hardly enough to topple a Chinese ruling dynasty. The Qing suffered no less than four humiliating foreign invasions, two massive rebellions, and innumerable smaller rebellions before the final Chinese revolution of 1911. 

A debt crisis will no more topple the Chinese government than the 2008 Subprime Lending Crisis toppled the U.S. Government. China's government will do what the U.S. Government did. Print off money and give it out as bailouts to its financial institutions and some of its state owned construction companies, and then let the other ones go bust. Then, it'll use its pervasive surveillance state, propaganda machine and good old fashioned state terror to monitor, redirect and if necessary, crush any anti-government sentiment that begins to fester among the new class of unemployed Chinese people. Not that it'll be hard to manage because unlike the Americans, the Chinese still have a staunch belief in their government, with many people believing that it is their duty to make China strong. On top of that, most Chinese people, just like most people in any country, are not smart enough to comprehend the labyrinthine nexus of financial and economic factors that would lead to a property crash, financial crisis and economic recession in China. When combined with an already strong sense of national purpose, this will make it very easy for China to blame this on the West, on Japan, on Taiwan, on any number of external threats or problems. 

Yes, in the long term this may shake public faith in China's economic institutions, it may even shake public confidence in China's government. But it will be decades before any of this amounts to anything."
ita funny because you see every where is chinese products how they go down they can sanction the world if they want to
"Good video with a much more temperate take on the nations fate. I have many friends there, so I hope that none of the horrid endings are real. I have fears though that it's not all in the CCP's hands.
It seems that you haven't factored in the impending famine. 2 years of flooding and 1 year of drought in the breadbasket of the nation has combined with ""African Swine Flu"" to create a ""REAL"" (read NOT merely financial) problem."
"This video, the comments is full of Chinese sponsored info, beware."
Just another China backed Channel.
So basically China might replace the US in the Future . Cause they have the signs..
Where's you're math? China is 360% to GDP debt.
"Wait... chance of rolling a double six and a double 4 is the same. The chance of rolling a 12 and an 8 with two dice are not the same, because more than one combination can make 8... some confusion how you worded that lol."
Just admit that the CCP is paying you. Would have saved us all a lot of time.
ofcourse they wont get destroyed...they rule the world.
Lmao finally someone with a brain
"People been living there in towns for 5,000 years, so‚Ä¶"
They don't have a Economy never have
Nooooooooooooooooo china will NOT collapse. Hope China will perish soon for their war crimes. They have no limits and emotions in their plan
"Idk, I think it will be 'China' style. The one we will learn from, a new one. They have more chances to recover and save themselfs in many ways."
"Those who know anything about history. Will likely know that often the greatest falls come not in the form of climactic destruction. 

They manifest as slow and painful whimpers."
"Just look at CNN ""China expert"" Gordon Chang. He been saying China collapse for 20yrs."
Your dice analogy at the end. I don't understand what you mean. The chance of hitting any double (or indeed any specific combination) is the same chance as hitting any other.
"yep.

money isn't real. China is one of the places that makes money.

They're safe."
"‚ÄúChina has been collapsing for years, but only as far as the Party lets it‚Äù"
Can you talk about possible Russian economy collapse?
Look I hate the Chinese government too but the economy isn‚Äôt going to collapse. Maybe in a few years it might but not now. Russia is the more likely to suffer from economic collapse.
China apologist.
""" China is collapsing in ... days ""
"" You will be a millionaire in ... days"""
The problem with ccp china is the country became too rich too fast while majority of the population is still earning low wages.
Exactly as I say in there comments
"It's pathetic how negative people are being and just following like a herd whatever YouTubers or whatever social media is saying about countries.  People even saying the UK is turning in to a failed state...because of inflation and a recession being driven by energy prices, affecting the whole WORLD, not just the UK for god sake.  It's pathetic."
"I didn't believe anyone telling me that China's economy was about to collapse. Similarly, I don't believe you telling me that China's economy will not collapse."
"Following up on China‚Äôs monetary independence, I am glad you have mentioned the fact that PBoC can basically print money to take the pressure of banks. However the main question remains, whether money printing will yield in high inflation and ergo lead to political turmoil as we see in the west. Similarly, capital controls lead to the same question, since it is by no means a nice tool for the population itself. 
I never really believed in the Chinese ‚ÄúWunderkind‚Äù slogan as I believe they went through the same stages as other main economies but faster and accumulated a lot of debt along the way which makes them vulnerable to a lot of things, not least political turmoil. Their reliance on trade surplus is also a shaky pillar since political turmoil in the west could easily slash the surplus as China becomes a more and more popular target for politicians to blame."

"More likely, if 20 or 30% of Chinese citizens with relatively new mortgages simply refuse to pay monthly on mortgages for properties that will never be finished, a number of Chinese banks will collapse.  But because the percentage of people refusing to pay mortgages is a CCP State secret, we will likely have no advance warning."
"I am sure YouTube likes your content. So you will not be demonetized.  People who disagree with you and Youtube have already been demonetized.  So in this way, the Truth is marginalized in favor of your content.  You are likely wrong, but more content creators can safely agree with you while those who disagree with you are silenced."
"You Miss one Big point here: The Government/Political System. The CCP always drew and draws it legitimacy from promises of Security and economic growth. And only through this legitimacy the system in itself can exist. 
Now what happened: 
1. The Chinese Vaccine just failed completely. While the rest of the world lives a rather pre-Covid live again, China still needs to have massive Health measures in place, cause the population lacks protection through either a vaccine or immunity after infection. This causes already upset and i suppose during fall and winter this will only increase and we could see large parts of the country under massive lockdowns just like we saw in shanghai in April. 
2. The economic growth and welfare, that the ccp promises: It is just off. People stopped paying their mortageges and so on cause they demand, to have their apartements build first. In such a repressive and controlled country it is absolutely rare to even see more then some people openly protest, but we see pictures of dozens of people blocking banks and demanding their money or their apartements. Also yes, the chinese banks are mostly state owned, but not by a central body, but rather by local governing bodies, which means it is not that easy to just bail them out etc. Also they lured people with wrong promises to make savings accounts, that were actually some kind of investment accounts. The Banks used them to speculate and guess what, they lost, now people demand their money too. 

So now when the two main legitimacy points of a totalitarian government are not fullfilled, i guess everyone can think of what could potentially happen. 

Also the land is rotten inside out in so many ways. The economy is not even half as strong and solid as everyone believes. Real estate makes up 70% of gdp and that bubble is nowhere near popped or defused by any means. I recall more then half of the property developers at least cross 2 of those 3 red line since over a year. (Dont quote me on this number here please). Literally Property development just is a huge ponzi sheme, while it is also the most popular investment asset for chinese people. Now the sheme is crumbling and the ccp tries everything that it not completely collapses. 

And thats just short term problems. 

Sure, i dont like the clickbait either, but still it is wrong to say, that the collapse wont happen. It is just normal economic business to always have bears and bulls about it and just the future might show, who was right and who wasnt. 
I for myself think, much depends on the rest of the year. Only if china manages to stabilize the virus situation and prevents large lockdowns while also getting their banking and property crisis under control they will be able to avert a harsh crisis."
Finally! I have no clue about all the economics and even I was annoyed about the sensationalism.
may EU will collapse before china
idk shit about this but you can't tell me that there is always one guy who has a disagreement. not saying  its bad but just wish everybody speaking about something important didn't have some sponsorship poking its ugly head behind a important message...
"Good to see the flip side of the economic's coin, thank you for the video."
"I watched the other videos and all I got out of em was that China‚Äôs economy was on the brink of collapse which spells a worse problem for the rest of the world, but would unlikely affect the CCP unless the revolts against the banks somehow became widespread revolts against the government."
"Bruh surely you didn't open up a video by CasgainsAcademy üòÇ

That guy is my favourite comedian by far. Never stops with the jokes"
The sudden uptick in China collapse nonsense can easily be explained by the $300 million put into propaganda by the united states.
Excellent arguments well supported with good reasoning

Finally some common sens.....
"Lovely, i love well thought out counter popular videos. keep it up!"
"We know about China's 18t  gdp, but what about the fact that China's oveall debt to gdp stands at 270%. Won't the lockdowns banking crises & drought cause this figure to increase and slow the economy further."
Putting tanks in front of banks to stop people from withdrawing their savings is a sign of a healthy economy
Ukraine war: Lies! China economy: Lies! Why does has the west become a hotbed for disinformation!
the first reason is a problem with the mega drought hampering production all over china
Finally a video that makes sense! I was getting annoyed how all those finance channels were simply parroting each other and news articles with no real analysis to back up their content. I was especially disappointed with Stephen Graham. In any case I really really enjoyed your analysis of the situation and didn't just parrot facts to us.
"its funny to see all the soothsayers claiming china will collapse, as an economy & as a nation

And also that for the first time in 100 years the Chinese population has gained a power. The power to not pay and stress the system till collapse"
You're all talkers. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty. And hungry.

"As a Taiwanese, I couldn‚Äôt be happier to see CCP suffered from their own medicines , but the truth like this video still needs to be told. We need turth not propaganda."
"Let me tell you why China isn't collapsing.
 1) external debt is relatively low compared to internal debt. The whole piig back in 2008 was because Greece owed foreign debt and force to cut spending. For example japan has a low external debt but a high internal debt which even though Japan is insolvent it has not collapse.

2) China is a credit nation meaning more money come in then go out. Capital inlow is higher than outflow.

3) all roads lead to China which can be seen in belt and road initiatives. 

4) Russia cheap gas and oil is benefiting China. 

5) Real estate is China's cancer. The patient has been smoking for ages. To tell him to stop is impossible, to tell him to slow down and not take excessive is possible. Especially when the government is taking initiative for soft landing. 

5) SOE creates a barrier. Evergrande is gone but China will put in liquidity to small companies and in essence inject liquidity to SOE. 

6) 4 to 5% growth is low for China but for the rest of the world is still amazing. If USA grow the tone percent a year we be celebrating."
"For sure china will face problems with their economy. But if you think of it, china doesnt have that much problem like other countries do. Mybe this time, china will have basic problem and we are not used to it coz we are used to be dependent on them."
Global population decline is bad?
"china will only fall into economy depression if every industry is overheating. So if the gov is stopping every industry from overheating, where will the economy collpase come from?

"So technically, this video admits the problems and admits that we cannot tell how big the impact will be, but argues that the recession could be ""short"". Yes, thank you! This video with this ""opposite"" type of title is more of a clickbait than a real counter-argument as it actually supports most of the arguments of the other videos. 
Pseudoscientific mate."

How surprising that western YouTubers are extremely biased
"Thank you, verry informative"
"Just a quick clarification comment about the dice example. 

I meant: 

Scenario collapse = throw 6,6
Scenario growth= throw 5,5 OR 4,4 OR 3,3
Scenario recession, intervention, stagnation= rest of the combinations."
Lol. This whole video is China won't collapse because authoritarians. Gotcha.
This is brought to you by the Chinese Goverment.
"100% right China wont collapse but its Economy and the world's Economy will have a really bad 2023.  I believe that in 2023 Chinese people will sell foreign assets in countries like US, Canada and UK.  Assets like stocks and real estate."
"Thank you for your balanced perspective. I couldn't agree more regarding how youtubers are creating unfounded over-hyped and unsubstantiated claims. However, I did come across this video that is more concerning regarding the future of China more from a demographic perspective https://youtu.be/wRT7P-VKM0k It would be great to get your perspective on this video"
"In my opinion, though, an additional risk factor for China's situation is simply the fact that the more controlled/centralised/planned economies the more vulnerable they are, as they have fewer mechanisms of self-regulation and are more susceptible to human error. Short term human decision can be a good and valuable thing but long term, in a game like a nation's economy, it can only be disastrous as conditions only change and there is no human mind or group of human minds that are right all the time. And when they are wrong the first time, the pressure increases and are forced into more and more errors untill an inevitable collapse."
Glad to see you're on the CCP payroll! keep up the fake posts!
all this fear-mongering is just giving Youtubers more viewers hence more money lol. Never let an opportunity go to waste.
why this video got recommended to me? im broke asf üòÇ
"I was sincerely amazed that this video is sponsored by morning brew, I would have bet the money behind it came from CCP"
"ccp will burn in 3, 2, 1..."
"China has enough foreign assets to bail themselves out, no?"

"China will crash is not about the debt. It's about the brutal Zero Covid policy where they wanted 0 Covid cases no matter what. look:-
1. Russia already made the first step by attacking Ukraine. 
2. Followed by the West's sanctioning the energy import from Russia which driving up gas prices.
3. FED raising interest rates due to inflation up to 9.1% and leaving hawkish comments based on the latest Jackson Hole last week.
4. Pelosi visit Taiwan, China wanted to attack but remain to play safe cause they know they can attack the west ""economically"" (which is in here zero covid policy + banning food from the west).
5. Saudis enter the game by manipulating the oil.
6. Drought across China & Europe.
If you say China will not collapse, I don't think so. China will collapse because of that stupid policy and drought. Europe with energy problem and winter is coming. The US with the debt problem and inflation. The food crisis across India and heavy rain in Pakistan destroyed everything. It is not just China, The US, and Europe all of us will collapse. It's a world recession now."
China is not a democracy. If the banks decide to take your money you have no recourse. Because the banks and the CCP are interconnected. Do you understand now why the Chinese economy could collapse?
Especially that seppo Gordon Chang lol....
Want to be?
You fail to really understand that when the people uprise the CCP will fail. That‚Äôs the biggest factor you failed to add up
thank you for this! subscribed . I  spoke to a friend from china and he made a lot of great points as we went through scenarios about a potential collapse and it just was not adding up. thank you for this!
At 5:08 China didnot rescue Evergrande...a property developer.
Can you do similar video about Russia? Every YouTuber seems to be saying that it‚Äôs about to collapse as well.
Energy and Food are China's biggest problem.  Real problems will start when the food system collapses and China cant get their oil transported from Russia and Middle East.
"As long china keep getting trade surplus, it will not collapse.  In concert with controlled yuan, the economy is absolutely chartered by the government.  Russia and China together will be unbeatable."
China will not collapse. The Chinese government have very deep pockets and they can fund their economic expansion if they wanted to!
"Avoid china like the plague. Crooked government, snake in the grass."
This is that hardest pro ccp cope I have ever seen in my life.
Wonder what the Chinese population will do though the longer this lasts
Incredibly how many times have you contradicted yourself.

China is standing on extremely thin ice right now. Even CHina GDP is a big fat lie. CHina situation is 100 times worse than they say. Corruption can only last so long.
Good nuance
"BOT CHANNEL DETECTED, DO YOU ALSO ADVOCATE FOR THE CCP?"
Love this counter argument. Makes sense. Wish mainstream news was like this. Wish we got arguments and counter arguments as well thought out as the videos I‚Äôm seeing on YouTube.
It seems like a bunch of YouTubers all heard about Peter Zeihan at the same time
"As a CNN daily viewer, I thought China economy already collapsed back in 1990s. Rejuvenated annually after 90s, Damn!"
"Great video! While I like the dice analogy at the end, the probability of getting double's is the same."
"Hi Joeri,

I am from the Chinese foreign party and just wanted you to know, You have done a great job in spreading the news. Now if I remember, you asked for compensation for one goat, two brownies, one Chinese moustache and Bam spray for that mould problem. Keep up the good work champ, or how we say it, go communism! Woot! Woot!

Chinese bots would not be that prevalent in this video, as it doesn't underline a negative view of china. 

All jokes aside, good video. I am giving it a thumbs up :)"
"You are aware that the probability of hitting double 3, 4, 5 and 6 is the same for all cases, right?"
"interestingly when author comparing cn and us, author mentioned that us has both housing and stock market bubble. cn on the otherhand has its stock market on the ground flat. hence it is very important to understand situation difference between the two."
"Assuming the counter position to a hyperbolic general consensus does not make you more right. 

You‚Äôre definitely correct in that a potential China crash isn‚Äôt like other crashes in the past, but I would think that fact is self evident, as very few economic ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù have happened in modern times. I would assume that every crash in the future will also be unique in itself. 

Your silly odds game of rolling dice analogy is dumb. 
Your charts are dumb. 

Your Phd adds almost nothing to your credibility to the macro economic future of a country you likely do not know in much detail. 
This is just a hot take from an internet contrarian with no business predicting the future of anything."
"9:16 One Child Policy is a must necessary policy in the last century as people will died in lack of enough food if the birth wasn't controlled. And the reason why people are not giving birth right now isn't because of it. The two children policy were out in 2016 but it didn't work is because most people or the middle class family in China doesn't want more kids. That's inevitable for most of middle classes in all countries that need a lot of money and resources to support a child. They can only want more kids, only if the country has enough welfare for a new born baby"
I think once they invade Taiwan is when they will collapse. Learning this info just shows how fragile their economy is. So right now it's our deterent to keep China from invading but also they could lash out because they are about to collapse.
The comments under your video are voluminous and suspicious.  It makes me doubt the truthfulness of your video.  I suspect you have an agenda.  Sorry.
So explain the mass mortgage protest then?
China will end up to be the largest economy in the world.
"A lot of the sites are just shock factor to be shocking and to get clicks
But

A lot of it is still true, the issues with the banks and the mortgages is a massive issue, the issue with the debt trapping African and South Asian countries is very real

A recession is already here in the US, and China feels that as well

It‚Äôs not unlikely to say something worse has the possibility of happening

Also, it‚Äôs quite hypocritical to claim that these people are making these videos ‚Äújust for clicks‚Äù and to be shocking, and to also say that China is completely fine

China is definitely not fine, if they were, their wouldn‚Äôt be thousands of people protesting
And China wouldn‚Äôt be trying to get their debtors to pay them back so desperately 

Refusing to negotiate till the UN stepped in 

These are massive issues, and can lead to a country being crippled economically 

Don‚Äôt let pride and the extremism of others influence you to dismiss these issues one way or another"
I was so confused while watching this video.  We have a mildly spoken person talking with big hand gestures. Great take on the china situatuon tho. Subbed
China will collapse...just maybe not in 30 days haha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QvtSbsX8Xk
"When it comes to news about China, I steer clear of American channels because most of them are biased and are inclined to say bad stuff about the country"
Great points!
"Finally, an objective review. I was sick of other videos that only talks extreme negative scenarios. As an expat living in China I can say a collapse is so unlikely to happen because of the dynamism of the people and businesses. There are so many relatively small size businesses that not only works hard but also smart. Economy seemingly slowing because of property but technology, innovation entrepreneurship are the main drivers that will only increase by time."
"Be bold when others are fearful, be fearful when others are bold."
"Improve your voice man, audio is so whack"
"I mean, the more doubt and mistrust we can sow into China the better. The only redeeming quality to come out of China are the sweatshops that drastically lower the prices of goods everywhere."
You ain't fooling me CCP agent. Lmao
YOU CAN NOT buy out of a collapse. this will come to high inflation and will make collapse look like party.
"Joeri, really enjoyed this video. I think you describe Chinas ability to control their economic situation well and we all better hope the scenario you predict as the most likely is true. To what extent do you see the recent news of companies either reducing or actually moving their manufacturing operations from China playing into this, and also the increase in Chinese students and citizens looking to migrate if they are able to? If this continues or accelerates, a major recession becomes more likely in day the next 3 to 5 years?"

"Dude, they will have to print Yuans like hell.  The banking system is dead. and the real  debt is way way  bigger. Property bubble is mad, 75% of the houses are not even built.   The banks  have invested the money of the property buyers on  highly leveraged deritvative products which will sink them,. Demographic colapse is already there. by 2050 china will half its current population. They debtors are not going to pay them as they are defaultoing, and the West is moving production back  home. 
It will not totally collapse, but a Super L  graphic is granted, Like Japan on  steroids.
China¬¥s economy cannot dissapear, but the target is the Communist party, that is at risk , a regime change might happen."
"I am sure many have commented‚Ä¶ but thats just 1 button too many for casual conversation. 
That chest got me heated. Quit seducing me lol"
Chine will not collapse because they steal money people of China
What about demographics?
Ur channel opens with a harbor freight advertisement.  LMFAO oOoOO
"Sure. China is not as resilient as this guy makes it sound. People there are super frustrated there due to drought, real estate problem, corruption, unemployment. They r running bullet trains with nobody traveling in it, their companies are struggling due to energy crisis. to add to thatz they are constantly threatening neighbors and trade partners.

All we get is US recession verus China current situation. Situation in China is much more serious, and may even lead to a political coup."
Thank you sir.
"No, Chinese economy will not collapse as the government will shift consequences to civilians. The likely outcome is that the whole China will return to the status like ""cultural revolution"" in 1970s."
China is the mother of all bubbles
It‚Äôs just bullsh!t propaganda or clickbait nonsense masquerading as ‚Äúeconomic news.‚Äù
"Your assumptions are based on the underlying strength of the Chinese economy, manufacturing, remaining strong but as you pointed out, covid lockdowns and terrible demographics have manufacturers racing to get out of China. Finance alone won't tank their economy, but steep declines in manufacturing coupled with major financial problems will."
"The issue with the Chinese bubble is that it might have been popped but it's internal economy is starting to collapse on it's own. Yes China might be saving it's big companies and banks but the civilian population is now feeling the start of the recession. 

The stagnation is either very likely or very unlikely based on the next moves the CCP will do."
"Where does China's Central Banks get the money to prevent an economic collapse ? As the author says, the US dollar is the basis currency and due to the US's stability and the guarantee of property protection investors flock to the dollar. That is not the case with China and as China's economy declines more and more investors will flee. I believe no one can actually predict China's collapse and I agree it's even harder to believe it will happen in the very near future. What I do believe is China's economy is slowing and declining to such a point it will be difficult for China to continue ""throwing cash"" at the ""Belts and Roads"" project or to even be able to maintain the dramatic increase in military spending. China's political system and its control of the banking system does place it in  a precarious position...if there's a serious hiccup then the CCP gets the blame."
"Chinese people had all of there money in those banks and lost all of it, and the Chinese government is only giving people up to $7,400. People are definitely going to protest and possibly riot."
The one important variable in all this is the zero Covid policy that China is trying to make work. They do it as a moral grandstand about how much more they care about every individual. Yet these exact policies are causing massive problems for them on every level. If I had to guess that is going to be what causes the most problems for them.

That is all western propaganda the fake media coming out of America is unreal. Americans have to be some of the most dumbed down people on the globe. This is all due to the corruption at highest levels of there government agencies. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèí

"This seems like CCP propaganda m/c.
China & Sri Lanka comparison is immature, ignorance."
"I have watched many videos about China about to collapse, but is it really going to happen? Come on is China,after watching this video it makes more sense China will not collapse easily. Not a fan of China totalitarianism though"
I keep up to date with macro economics since I'm starting an e-commerce business but hearing all this got me worried for awhile lol people don't realize how bad a Chinese collapse would hurt the supply chain
"This is MMT applied. Very good video, I agree with it 100%"
"worlds no.1 export country does not fucking collapse all of a sudden, these economy YT analysts need to stop spreading false information. They are only feeding what the people would like to hear because China has been portrayed as the bad guy in this ideological fight"

"Economies like every other manmade construct is built off faith. Faith in one's institutions, faith in one's currency and so on. Once that faith has been shattered, the construct too shatters. How else do you think wars, rebellions and civil wars erupt? Notice I didn't say bend, warp or even crack. I said shattered.
So, can China's economy 'collapse'? Uh, yeah. It all comes down to how much belief the citizenry has left."
Yeah they can still turn it around.

"This guy seems to have more knowledge and experience, education, intellectual than the CEO of Chinese HUAWEI....BUT is this possible  ??!! for any outsider like this guy ???¬ø¬ø I don't think so.

So a failing Chinese economy is very bad news for the blue collars and the rest of the human race in the world üåé. 
I hate to see Chinese failing on any field. It affects us directly."
"I don't think it will collapse but it can collapse... china has other problems next to economy like people trying to leave country and incrasing old/youth ratio while population is also shrinking without an immigrant intake.
economy is just cherry on top... so... it can happen if china takes a wrong step wich is not easy to fail"
"Last time China ""crumbled"" it was when they simply ""REBRANDED"" from ""dynasty"" to ""CCP"".
And guess what? They maintained all the typical feudal systems....just swapping names / titles.
LOL China's the type of country that will let their people be sacrificed to keep the ""system"" afloat. It's not the other way around.

Most people don't seems to know how China really works huh? :P"
Nice Work.
"China definitely has manufacturing strength to support it, but their debt to gdp is much higher than even the US.
QE and lowering rates will only add to it. Sometimes I'm baffled as to how the whole thing stays together at all"
"Sadly i did the same thing just out of curiosity. And me going ""this is pretty stupid"". Glad you bring some balance to this youtube void."
"China's economy might not collapse, but I feel that this explanation is oversimplistic. If countries could just bail out their banks that easily, learning from the Great depression, that's too easy and nobody would ever have a recession ever again"
"Thanks for this video, was starting to get annoyed by all those video but couldn‚Äôt find what was wrong with them !"
"yes. thank you. such bullshit these days. essentially, people wish for this to happen. it won't happen. it's similiar to the three gorges dam crap. people wish for it to collapse not caring one bit for the millions who will die. not a fan of the CCP but wishing death to Chinese citizens, mass starvation, etc....is sick."
"1. China's political system isn't like US. Yeah it's more like Venezuela's.
2. China's economy isn't like Sri Lanka. Yea ""too big to fall"" for sure."
...each double is equally likely...
"So your conclusion is China won't have a great depression because China will spend aggressively to protect the banks.... good luck with that.ü§£

There's a human variable, go ahead and protect banks, see what the regular people do. Lockdown, hold people financial in place, just tighten those restrictions, keep tightening and increase control over the people and bail out the banks.... yup... it will be fine. ü§£"
"If China doesn‚Äôt collapse in 25 days or whatever will those YouTubers admit they were talking shit and fold up in embarrassment by any chance or go on regardless, spouting more sensational bullshit. Yep,no doubt the latter."
"Several issues where this guy seems way too optimistic. 1. China has a shadow debt crisis.  Land leases accounts for 40% of local government revenue.  This shadow debt is estimated to be at least the same size of total Chinese GDP. These local government funding vehicles take on debt to fund local services using land leases as revenue against the loan.  2. China is facing major loss leaders in different sectors at the national government level, like the high speed rail systems. 3. Companies are fleeing China and most of what it makes can be made elsewhere. They don't have high tech specialization that make them irreplaceable. 4. The banks aren't jumping on the save the real estate market bandwagon. They are finding unique ways to show increased loan activity, like inter bank lending or lending to stable corporations and then depositing their money at the same interest rate. The real estate market accounts for 30% of total GDP and 70% of Chinese wealth. That is in process of an epic collapse, it doesn't matter how much they spend, we are talking trillions of dollars of debt to right the system. 5. Forget about shadow debt,  the published Chinese national debt, which you can't trust is 2.5x GDP. They can't print their way out of it. 6. The population decline is way worse than the Chinese are letting on. They will not have the work force to maintain the production they need in 20 years."
Did just read 2 Chinese banks have started bankruptcy procedures...which can't be good .
"Good video and thoughtful analysis.

I do have one quibble:  The left hand side scale on the charts about China are a bit misleading.  They don‚Äôt start at zero.  Far from it, in fact.  So it makes the debt and asset price movements appear larger than they are.  I understand that part of the issue is using an index vs actual amounts.  But it‚Äôs still a bit of a visual trick that many people probably didn‚Äôt realize due to the fast pace.

Other than that, good video."
"Even cannibalism and eating mud and 45 millions lish people died economy, and mao china still rock solid, Chinese suffering is way beyond death was shockingly sad, but proven ccp china still there, plus US and the world is totally addicted and hooked by china manufacturing and huge market super of all super power, like putin fuel but far far more powerful. Wait till china grab taiwan and south ea eastern trades by soft to hard power force, all eastern world tiny baby states under china 1 man 1 party control"
"From an economical point of view, yes, they are self-sufficient enough to sustain through whatever might happen, that's true. But it's not quite true that they can just supply an infinite amount of money, particularly not when the crash is this severe. And as self-sufficient as it is, a huge issue is still from a development and global trade point of view. A country that ""just prints more money"" is rarely great in terms of your import and export situation. Considering how much the CCP is involved in stocks, and how tied in they are with a LOT of companies these days, things like this can impact the global stock market, so for those afraid of their portfolio being hit short term (Which you shouldn't care about unless you are a daytrader) this is still a major concern. 

The GDP is also a large focus of a lot of these videos, and that will plummet as a result of the crash, no matter what happens at this point. Which is a ""crash"", albeit a theoretical one that shouldn't matter as much as most Youtubers make it out to be, so while they are not ""wrong"", they do fail to understand how little importance is really has. It is as the joke goes, if you pay someone 100$ to eat shit, and then you get paid back that 100$ if you eat shit yourself, you just increased the GDP by 200$. 

The funny thing is, none of them actually say the country will outright collapse. The clickbaits are just ...fearmongering? Hopemongering? I'm not sure when the topic comes to China, but they aren't keeping the doom and gloom up in the actual videos. Only one I remember said it might lead to the political collapse of the CCP, but I don't think that's likely, nor necessarily a good thing. That kind of collapse doesn't have to lead to something better."
"Great Job, seriously."
"While it seems reasonable, lets not forget how it went with russias warchest deal, id say the collapse is more likely rolling double 1 1s and double 6s 6s, not exactly impossible but theres a still decent alright for it happening though stagnation seems like a more reasonable estimate of what will happen"
You can see China's economy from space.
"My think lockdown people to keep them (the workers) alive is good for long term benefits and crack down on private sector is just what normal communist do.(BTW Rich people do not produce, the workers did)"
Why would anyone think that China would fail over a few billion?
All we can hope is that China doesn't collapse because it would drag the whole damn world with it.
"it's been said before: ""China's economy is sure to collapse in 29 days......and always will be""!! üòÜ"

"Thanks for covering this! I also got sucked into the clickbaity-ness of the other youtubers covering this, and it felt over done and sensatonalized, whilest also trying to extort subs and likes from views as a ploy to fight the ""chinese bots"".

A car park space sold for $1m the other week‚Ä¶ you think China isn‚Äôt sitting on a debt bubble? üòÇ
"Yes. So about that Capital Control, it works, but it actually doesn't. If money is restricted from free flow (like in russias case), the government can artifically increase value of their currency which doesn't translate to its true value on global market, just like russia did. For simplification lets assume that you have a car. You say this car is worth 10 millions,, that's for how much you want to sell it and how much you think it's worth or at least other people should think it's worth. But in reality, it won't be worth this much until somebody comes and buys it for this price."
"I clicked on this video hoping to get the opposite of the idiocy I see in those exact videos... I feel I just got more of the same but pandering towards the other perspective.

This issues are deeply complex and I know cannot be covered properly in a 10minute video, but even the way you glossed over stuff that I am pretty well aware of felt so surface level as to be completely wrong.

I think I just need to stop clicking on these 10-15min ""informative videos""."

"I do agree with your analysis that the combination of demographic issues, and mismanagement around real estate + heavy handed policies is setting up for a Japan style decline. The big question will to answer is whether Xi and the CPC can sustain the inevitable social pressures which will build. Moving from an expansionary outlook to a stagnant one is not easy to manage politically"
"People just don't understand how currency works.  Whether in the US or China.  China has a trade surplus so they don't have much debt in foreign currencies.  They can spend all they want inside of China as they see fit.  They wont go broke, and they wont collapse."
It seems yall share the same thumbnails and titles or just copy them. Nice clickbait
"So one point that is worth considering thats not mentioned here is the current drought and aridification of much of china.

"Lmao anything for views, said the same thing, it's like they all live in China and knows how it's really going on."
"Good clickbait title! Noticed that you literally didn't touch on one thing covered in the other videos. If you're going to argue against another opinion, in order to win people over you probably should dispute the other claims and show why they are false, and why your decision is correct. Not just acknowledge they are there and then dance around by talking about 2 other factors that are not correlated in any way. Hilariously bad channel"

Except that a major crash DID precede Japan's lost decade so concluding that it will be like Japan would imply a crash.
All the economies will collapse soon
double 6 is not rarer then other doubles
Nice video sir
"maybe .but I think there is a factor that Westerners would neglect.Xi is not rational and lack of judgementÔºåand of course don't know about western values and thinking methods.
so if he remains in power,he will continue to act by ideological fictions,illusions and political dispute and fight rather than facts.
he will continue to defy and ruin the flexibility and redundancy of chinese economy no matter how much potential power it contains not by his will but will be carried.
and hoping for the communism totalitarian regime to fall down is understandable but the collapse of this size of economy will be a hemorrhagic shock for every state.
prophecies like Nostradamus often revealed the Doom's days.this is really beyond the imagination of human kind."
Yikes. The likelihood of rolling two 3's is the same likelihood as rolling two 6's... someone with a channel about money and mathematics should *probably* know that.
"Well i wont collapse 4 sure, but to live in China wil get much worse."
Too many of these analysts are hopped up on anti-china fervor
One of the main reason the government of China is purposely creating the condition of a real estate sector cool down is their push for common prosperity. Due to the fact that the Chinese finance sector is new and not mature. Most chinese ppl invest in real estate. The older generation can end up with 6-7 apartments. While the new younger generation is facing increasing cost. The younger generation is also vastly more pro communist than the older generation that have seen turmoil like the culture revolution. Therefore it is in the government's interest to make sure the market deleverage and prices drop in order that their biggest block of supporters can afford to buy a home like their parents.
"Sick of those ""finance"" channels using ridiculous thumbnails featuring Jerome Powell or Xi Jinping and words like ""COLLAPSE"" in everything with fire or red arrows pointing down! The US isn't collapsing and neither is China. Things are going to be bad for China for sure. Unlike America, the real estate mess was the CCP's own doing. Unlike in the US, where the Fed raising interest rates made taking out home loans more expensive. In china despite lowering interest rates, nobody is still buying."
Well Rusha is feeding china with oil and gas at the price of sea water. China is a monster feeding on everything she can find!
"Any state policy regarding currency is seen as ""protectionist"" and smeared as not working in the real world. Well, turns up Capital Controls can save entire countries from the absolute ruin."
Lol what a low tier Chinese PRC shill your plugging of a certain video made it so obvious.
they'll still probably have that war though.
"doesn't printing more money also a problem, it will devaluate the Chinese currency, just like it happened in Germany after WWII"
"It took about a year for Evergrande to be downgraded to the point where it cannot be used a collateral.  The Big Short movie highlights how the market prices go up at the same time the underlying assets experience defaults.   Evergrande is making interest payments for local debt, however Evergrande is not paying back the foreign debts.  Everyone knows China is not 100% forthright with their data - especially economic data.  Putting all this together - It seems like China has zero incentive to tell the rest of the world how bad their economic crash is, and China will isolate/fix their internal economics with house money while ignoring everyone else.  This is the exact same precedent for what China does with stolen intellectual property.  

The fact of the matter is that there is enough toxic debt trapped in China's real estate sector to destroy entire economies.  What happens if other countries fail because of China, and China prevents their own economic downfall at the expense of those other countries?  Isn't this grounds for a war, or something that would happen at the end of a war - like a new Treaty of Versailles to pay reparations for the resulting economic collapse(s)?  It seems like since China has some degree of control (like the potential to nationalize any company they want to) over their real estate bubble - that they (China) owe some degree of responsibility over the potential ripple effects of Evergrande.

Either way - what I am getting at is this: We will never have unrestricted access into China's economy.  Look at the way the China zero DIVOC policy was documented and executed.  So how will anyone ever know if China's economy collapsed!?  What metric will be used to determine that China's economy crashed?  If other countries crash because of China's bubbles popping, does that mean anything about the health of China's economy?  Can we infer that China's economy crashed if they take down any other countries economies along the way?  

I'm asking for a friend - thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."
Not yet. 8th September. 2040. Mandate of Heaven üôè.
"Countries go through corrections, recessions and depressions.  That doesn't mean they collapse and their civilization disappear forever.  Right now China still run trade surpluses meaning they generate more value that they take.  More concerning should be countries who run massive deficits like Sri Lanka (or dare we say it, India and the USA?)."
"I said i will report all those who made videos about ""30 days until collapse"""
"@All - Isn't majority of those america and china uncovered, presented by journalist chris chapel?"
How much you got paid??
Loved the analytics‚Ä¶by the way the chance of double 6 or double any same number with dice is the sams 1/36‚Ä¶:)
I WISH China would collapse!  The Yangtze is a puddle and their IS drought!  Some cities flooded up to 2nd floor of skyscrapers.  It is NOT in as good as shape as China would have you believe!
Eindelijk een tegengeluid tegen al die DOOM en gloom clickbait in! Thnx a lot!
Hmmm didn't we see this before 6 months ago?
"I am in silent shock when I see sofa bed youtuebrs making videos about the collapse of China in 34 days. Everyone is knowledgable about China, except the Chinese government.  LOL."
Would be a lot cooler if they did
Every few years since 2008 there's a headline of an impending Chinese economic collapse. Never happens.
"Nahh, more likely an attempt to diverse our attentions. After all, the economy of the west is getting down during the previous years so the east is better target for govts to transfer our thoughts."
I agree China economy will not collapse.
"I keep telling people, America will collapse long before China but no one believes me."
Of course China will come out stronger.
"You are right it is not fair to let the banks get away with blowing up the financial system. That's why they should have been legally removed from control of that system, and replaced. Don't just let them get away with market manipulation."
"So what is purpose of this video?

To tell critics of the CCP that looking for its collapsed, these are not the correct indicators?

To teach people to appreciate that whilst indicator of financial stresses might looked the same but it needs to be contextualised - i.e. I don't care about politics only teaching economics in objective manner?

Or something else?"
üòÇ yes.
He is absolutely wrong it will collapse for the simple fact that the whole world works on a debt system. And they are suppressing there citizens aka communism the only saving grace for them is WAR and that is why very soon China will be invading Taiwan and then other small countries wait and see
"I'm more worried about the political instability this will cause. China's governing systems are notorious for being unstable, and I'm not sure the CCP has done anything to buck that trend. I still have a really bad feeling about the things going on over there. Best to for other countries to lower their dependance on China now, because I don't see them as being very reliable as time goes on."
Nice. Interesting points and finally a decent answer to the Youtube warmongers
"The stupid thing about all this is that the Great Depression didn't destroy America; nor did the Great Recession. So ok, maybe China even goes through something worse than the Great Depression ... well actually, news flash, they already did a couple of times in the 20th century, and they're still here. A trend can collapse, a boom can bust, maybe even an entire model can collapse, but robust systems can weather these things. So the real question should be, could it be comparable to the collapse of the Soviet Union? Because that's the sort of thing that would warrant the use of the work COLLAPSE in all caps. I can't quite make the leap from real estate bubble, however massive, to equivalent to the USSR collapse though. Of course, the housing crisis isn't the only crisis looming at the moment, so it's a fair thing to debate, but far from a settled question."
"Will China face economy challenges? Sure YES.            
Will Chinese Economy collapse?  Hell NO."
Fear sells.
Very well done.  The Chinese population collapse seems to me the big one.  But that will take some time.
"dude these youtube ""gurus"" are actually only good at youtube algorithms and regurgitating news headlines info"
"Systems collapse when there is a better alternative - so for all the massive problems with the US and China, there doesn't seem to be a better alternative."
"At last, someone not selling superiority of the west by trashing china or Russia."
"I agree that a total Chinese collapse is probably the least likely scenario.  The CCP has shown in the past the lengths to which they will go to maintain order and control.  But, I do think this puts a major dent in several of their aspirations.  Regardless of how well they weather the storm, I don't believe foreign investment is coming back.  Those investors dealt with China's stringent policies for over a decade due to the perceived strength of the Chinese economy and the belief that it would soon Surpass the U.S. economy as the world's superpower.  But, the investors were burned often enough when times were good, that the bath they will take due to the real estate bubble popping will likely keep foreign investment away for some time.  And China seems stubborn enough to me to decide they don't need foreign investment, given the policies they have already implemented to gain financial independence.  So, I agree.  Stagnation and slow decline appear to be the most likely outcomes."
"chinas economy is goin to fail in 3.14159 days exactly.  Then all government officials will move to Mars where they have secretly started a martian base and will separate themselves into a new variant off human species with little in common with earthlings anymore.  Then The rest of the world will collapse in 6.28 weeks after china leaves for Mars.  Soon after A.I will finally become a true super power.  All people will rise up against governments and we will put AI in power and all governments will be completely transparent and crypto will be the only currency everywhere on the planet.  All military funding will immediately be switched to humanitarian funding all over the globe.  All guns and weapons will be destroyed and eliminated.  AI will continually search the web to delete all CAD files and info talking about any sort of weapons to continue to reduce any spread of violence. 


This is not a guess.  This will 100% happen EXACTLY as I have stated."
China‚Äòs economy is not going to collapse. It already has.
"dice probabilities are wrong, 66 and 33 are equal, 66 is superior only by convention. here's my take: EVERYTHING is a tussle between east and west. west has been wrong all along but wants to show east has been wrong all along and achieves this via media manipulation. for instance, when it suited the west, ip was not an issue, now ip is the only issue and stuff like that. west would always try to wrong foot china. so only after china takes full control of south china sea, it would wrest control and so on. yes china would survive but only to prove west right and only to fill west pockets"
How much is the CCP paying you?
My turn to be the dislike button
I think you are just a simp of Chinese CCP and just want to say only good arguments to win Xi Jinping's approve.
"I think its somewhere in between, as far as I can understand several rich Chinese have successfully smuggled their fortunes out of China, many are moving to foreign countries so the money control is not working optimally. Chinese products are also more frowned upon than 5 years ago, at least in Europe and the US many consumers would rather spend a little more for a local product in most cases. Hence I see a larger recession as the most likely scenario and a more prolonged slowdown of their economy. By no means would it be a collapse but China will likely not be the biggest economy by 2030 as many have been predicting for years."
"people confuses their desires with reality. It happens at every level, that's why we are living through the complete collapse of western civilization (this time for real)"
HAHAH thank you China  has a controlled economy. We are a capitalist economy. Very different
Finally! So many other YouTubers being overly dramatic for the views/likes‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll be a few bumpy months but not a complete collapse of anything
"The first recent bank run in China, had customers waiting for months with bs excuses as why they couldn‚Äôt withdraw money, system updates, fraud detection alerts when trying to withdraw money from the atms and cancelled cards that is definitely not short lived. The one high interest savings account that scammed all those people of money the government told the people we are only able to return up to a certain amount after a few months went by letting the people know they should of done their due diligence before investing or depositing money to a bank even if they‚Äôre currency is state owned they couldn‚Äôt refund all those people the exact amount of money that was lost in those savings accounts‚Ä¶ Sure you can learn from past mistakes but they are clearly still learning and haven‚Äôt learned because they‚Äôre housing bubble is the biggest the world has ever seen so clearly Lesson not learned well enough. There are major factors in play for China for it to possibly have a major recession maybe not economic downfall but a very hurting economy for the months to come. Look at Taiwan you got now American senators just flying into Taiwan regularly talking trading deals after China screamed war if they were to set foot on Taiwan and nothing just a bunch of cry wolf military drills. Citizens over there are protesting and loosing faith in their government because of false promises like starting a war if Americans set foot on Taiwan soil. This video just seems to me that was just made to make it seem it isn‚Äôt that bad over there for people that are living in smaller cities that are gravely impacted by this. Now there‚Äôs massive droughts in their rivers which is making harder for imports to be shipped because of low water flowing through they‚Äôre canals to be ready to export to the rest of the world. Reading through the comments a lot of fake accounts just saying how right he is, viewers are definitely not all legit"
"Yeah, I think you have a clear and logical view of the situation. I don't like that this bad monetary practices  continue to get bailed out by government puppets,  but I am just one of many. All I can control is how I hedge my bets being a lowly poor person."
chyna is dying üòîüôè
Thank you for dispelling the fear mongerers
"People love predicting crisis, don't see much difference between them and doomsday prophets that keep changing dates when their predicted collapse comes and goes"
"Like always, someone is going to be right in there predictions at some point. I personally think what we're witnessing here is WW3 and the battlefield is  the flow of information, financial sabotage, food security and culture with the end game being the dissolution of the CCP and possibly the fragmentation of current day China."
This is the more reasonable video for the current china economics.
"Nothing can survive in a vacuum.  Eventually the Chinese will run out of options, like everyone else.  No spectacular collapse, but a Soviet style era of stagnation. 

The EU and the US are wary of those horridly lopsided trade deals, and the idea of putting all eggs in one basket. Also, a looming stand-off with the West over Taiwan will weigh heavily on the Chinese economy. 

I consistently hear the US/EU will collapse if they shut of China. This, is inherently false."
Remember USA Congress in 2022 set aside $500 million to fund propoganda against China. I wonder if any of those youtuber are recipients of this money
Appreciate if media could stop bad mouthing China. Jealousy and bad mouthing goes together.
It is equally likely to roll 2 sixes as it is any other combination with two dice
This kind of video is why I subscribed this channel.  There are so many junky materials out there on youtube.
"The main thing to remember about the ""China is crashing"" youtubers is that they have been predicting it was going to be any day now for years."
"The chinese banks can provide the money? I love your videos, but haven't you seen that people have been denied cash withdrawals?"
"Whilst you are correct from an economic standpoint you are also forgeting about the whole political side. 

Many countries don't like china and are actively trying to lower their dependence, this(long term and definitely not a few days), may cause big issues for china due to their heavy investments into the international market.

There's also the issue in regard to its own people, the situation in china is very bad and people living there are restless, which is often not good for an economy. A big factor in the value of money is trust in it, if enough become distrustful, well you can guess.

There is also the whole deal with bouycuting(word?), which may have investors worried.

The country is a dictatorial communist state, a closer(albeit far from perfect) comparison may be ww2 germany and old soviet."
You forgot completely manufactured currency‚Ä¶
"Ya thats it, China can print it way out of this. LMAO. Because its worked so well in the west"
"""At some time in the future, the Chinese economy will collapse""!
There, how's that?  üòä"
getting double 5 is just as likely as double 6
You more likely hit double five than double six?
Japan has never recovered from its stagnation though.
"China WILL collapse. Here is why:

1) China makes cheap products and uses low tech sweat shops which add NO value to their products 

2) Their economy is FAR smaller - like a fraction of USA or Europe 

3) They have NO influence or ports outside of China 

4) USA dominates World trade 

5) USA has a military far superior to China and dominates trade routes 

6) China has poor infrastructure 

7) China has severe corruption and poor leadership 

8) It is communist which means no free market advantages 

9) Zero to little foreign investment 

So you see, China WILL collapse

EDIT: The 9 reasons are outdated reasons in the 1970s. It no longer holds true now in 2022."
"The covid pandemic was cause by incompetent and corrupt local government trying to cover it up. The energy crisis was caused by the CCP doing nothing about upcoming energy shortage but instead bullying aussies causing them to ban coal export to china. The real estate bubble was created by the CCP by doing nothing but letting local governments totally depend on real estate development causing the average chinese to spend 70% of their savings to pay mortgages for houses that hasn't even been finished yet. There are also sooooo many political crakdowns by the CCP on economic sectors such as ban on private education, ban on entertainment, randomly putting sanctions on neighboring countries for political reasons, ban on video games, and the whole common prosperity nonsense followed by ridiculous zero covid lockdowns... the CCP basically created every single crisis china facing today by itself! 

And still you believe somehow the CCP knows the economy better than the US and can overcome one of the biggest economic bubble in the history in less than 5 years. Well I think the CCP will certainly agree with you bc it will certainly argue that the recession never had happened even if it had, just like they fake covid cases right now."
All youtubers are experts.  YouTube university of course. Lol
"Finally, someone who isn't following the herd and is speaking facts."
"Hahaha so many whites urge to see chinese suffer. Two words for u, KEEP DREAMING."
"Depends on your definition of ""collapse"". Maybe not Sir Lanka... but probably more like 1980's Japan, or 2007 US. We'll how they try and navigate out of their troubles."
China collapsed. Unlikely it will happen. Chinese hold huge amounts of gold in their vaults.
Really?? You compared China with Sri Lanka to convince the collapse isn't happ? Brilliant!
"""Quite literally run out of steam"".   Really?  I was not aware that the Chinese economy operated on steam power.  Ah, maybe he means ""figuratively""."
"Agreed, the videos said chinas economy collapses in 30 days. And then a few days later the title was changed with a different clickbait screen. Most countries are going through a recession at the moment, wages and wealth are being scrutinised and housing is going down. None of this is a good thing or bad, it happens every 10 years in one of the top 30 countries anyway."
"While I generally agree with your assessment, I don't think China is in for a  Japan style ""lost decade""."
"The most sensational yt channel on this topic is in my guess is ""Business Basics"". I have been following the channel for very long time for the content it's name suggest. But in a past few week or even month all of sudden it's all China and it's collapse.
I don't really care if the content is Pro Or Anti anything until it is factual and accurate. But in this case it seems otherwise. I hope he sees this video and make a counter argument to defend its arguments."
"It's important to mention that current capital flight from China mostly consists of 1. flee of international ""hot money"" and 2. devaluation of foreign reserves (such as euro). The total FDI amount in China is actually INCREASING despite the Fed's aggresive monetary policy"
"china is collapsing. Xi can print money like he has since 2006 but collapsing demography, energy dependence, agricultural dependence, central government failure, an inability of 90% of their navy to sail beyond 1000 miles, massive debt bubble, cheaper manufacturing available elsewhere... there's no reason to believe that China is doing well. Pointing to the great depression or Venezuela or fucking youtubers doesn't make them automatically doing fine"
If China needs money all they need to do is to sell the US treasury.
I don't care if China collapses. But talking about it gives me the chills ü§£
Imagine supporting a genocidal regime that suppresses its own people and wants to control people‚Äôs minds
I tend to Agree with you however  I think the rest of the worlds debt will pull down on the Chinese economy. Things could go either way depending on the timing of China's and other countries actions.
they just playing the youtube algorithm...
Well done! China is not the same as the United States. Their response to the housing crisis will be different and have different outcomes.  You take the anaylisis to the next level knowing that the situation is dynamic.  I also appreciate the acknowledgment that you don't have a crystal ball and can't predict the future.  This may not get you as many clicks but keeps your content grounded in reality.  Thanks for the video.
How much did China pay you ?
How much you wanna bet that the ccp paid you.
And China just say be quiet or we end you to it‚Äôs citizens so it‚Äôs different that way too
You need a better mic
"ehhh, dude, hitting double 5, or 4 or 3 has exactly the same probability as hitting double 6! What you wanted to say is hitting 10 in summary (one 4 and one 6, or double 5) has higher probability than hitting double 6 (12 in summary)."
"I have a feeling that Business Basics is a anti-china propaganda channel or jumping on the anti-china bandwagon to make some easy $$$ by looking at what videos they've uploaded. Doesn't help they like to use fear ambient music along with leaving the ""what if"" to our let our bias/imagination fill in the gaps."
They deserve to crash
"china imports 85% of it's energy, 85% of it's food. The cost of chinese labour has increased 12x from 1999. they have no food, they have no energy, they have no cheap labour, they have the worst demographics of any country of any country in history (no young workers, no consumer base). You're viewing this from the perspective of 1930s USA while ignoring all of these issues"
The demographics of China is a much bigger problem then a temporary housing bobble.
2x days later. All the posers look like idiots. Your channel stays trusted. I think all those people made a huge mistake  for just a few views in the short term. Thank you for being the voice of sensibility.
"David Mitchell =-D I love common sense intelligent content like yours to counter all the click bait trash out there, keep up the good work <3"
Most rational and sensible economist in youtube. <3
"Is gonna collapse, for other reasons and further in time."
"There's a reason why the "" finance YouTubers"" are on YouTube and not at Blackstone"
"I keep telling people that the negative rhetoric surrounding China is nothing but confused, psuedo-intellectual YouTube Economists creating clickbait. We are single-handedly handing over title of global superpower to China lol."
"- First Because corruption in china's banking systems around 41mil+ was stolen from China major state owned bank and they closed. That's just 1 of the state banks it happen to 3 of them.
China did not just print money to replace the stolen funds.
Chinese citizens are protesting right now trying to get there live saving back to pay for their mortgages

1/3 of the counties GDP was built on credit from restate sector as in NoT REAL MONEY.
No China cannot just print money.

- Second lets talk about Restate
This bubble was crash by the CCP because it would of eventually lead to Chinas internal collapse your are correct.
But how will china maintain its growth while crashing its other profitable sectors?

- Money Control
China can control its money from leaving the country? but in the same sentence millionaire are fleeing the country in droves
The intelligent and well educated people are leaving and taking the money with them?
This Brain drain will not be easy to recover from. 
No China cant contain its money.

How much did they pay you?"
"Ah, well looks like my doomsday preparations won't be put into use, fortunately since I got no doomsday preparations aside from a single can of canned pasta."
"I think predicting what the CCP may do is a futile endeavor.

But they will literally squish their citizens under tank tracks before they let the whole thing collapse.

But exactly how are they monetarily independent if they are so dependant on imports?
Their dollars will run dry quickly won't they?"
"China has had to close many of its factories due to the extreme heat, the drought and drying up of their rivers, and subsequent loss of ability to generate hydroelectric power.  They are facing very large crop losses.  These should be factored into arguments about the stability of China's economy."
This shit confusing
"9:33 You greatly underestimate China's ability to fuck things up. Chabuduo is their motto. Which roughly translates to good enough. Plus, what are those goods they produce? Manufactured garbage probably won't be missed."
"It's too easy for me to eat up propaganda that is anti china, because I want so badly to believe that their system of autocratic institution and state centered idealism, by crushing the individual, will always produce more human suffering, less good and stand only to lie to the world, but the YT algorithm doesn't know that..........."
Just like ghost Of Kiev
As much as I dislike china's government I found very laughable those clickbait thumbnails about Chinas collapse hahaha
Thank you for your insight. Please share with us your expectations for North America (esp. the US)
Question: What about the capital invested by foreigners (for example: plants built by western firms in China) ? Are there also forbidden to quit ?
"Lol, I watched those videos, and I was like, yeah right, no way one of the world economy superpower will collapse in less than a month"
They can just send the army out to sort it
"Yeah, but China prints money crazy.  They make the US look like amateurs when it comes to debt and make more and more money whenever you need to.  You are missing so much, on how the great debt Ponzi economy and how horribly the CCP has managed this, you almost sound like shill.  Whatever you do, do not invest in China.  Such a titular view on what's going on in China."
The swarm of videos reminds me of of attack campaigns on shorted companies.
Thank you very much. Very clear and wel fundameted.
People seem to be really really invested in seeing China fail. I know the CCP does some bad shit but it still doesn't seem proportionate to the hate. Do people feel threatened?
"Nop... China's Economy Will not Collapse... But not for the reasons you describe. 
People's lives will be crushed and families will be destroyed in silence. The CCP controls all news media and any opposition or unrest will be crushed and silenced. 
China is not the West...They don't have a Justice system that stands for the little guy, and you are not free to speak your mind in their system."
I think one thing you should explore is the possibility actually complete likelihood that some of these youtubers are actually on the dole of some state dept or CIA cutout NGO.
You have not mentioned that China has had several  stimulus injections to the economy during the great re of 2009 leading to local government and state owned debt . Total debt to gdp is over 260 %since 2015.  There is  the shadow banking sector with 8 trillion of debt and a slowing economy  with a rapidly  aging workfyrce  Real Estate is 30 % of the economy and house prices  are the highest globally terms of incomes to price much higher than the  US   There now a deflation  in the sector .
I don't think it is even a ~2.8% chance of china's collapse (odds of rolling boxcars).  They have too many tools to prevent that.
"Why do you believe a Japan-style recession to be the most likely endgame for the current crisis? And do you think a shift away from economic dependence on Chinese manufacturing, fulfilling various predictions of ‚Äúdecoupling‚Äù from China, would change the probabilities here?"
Could you make a video about the idea of a zero growth world. Like the authors from Donut Economics and Less is more describe?
Didn't watch a single one of these videos. They just looked ridiculous.
"YES IT IS (just don't know when)
The whole Chinese economy is based on  the principles of Charles Ponzi and, therefore MUST collapse. 
There is no other way out"
"no collapse, but will be a recession"
Srilanka crisis also cause by china .china faced some much big crises under go .china now not provide loans to that country.but Everglades crisess .china economy slows growth .that's why china agression on the  neighbours increase for diverting people mind .china faild to complete it's cpec and other programs which are started in other countries . Winter are coming for chinaüòÇ
Brilliantly said! Sub'ed
I don't agree. I don't see how China will be able to keep a stable economy by inflating it's already low value currency
"china stil owes me 300 billion dollars. wtf is my money, xi?"
China is still in the toilet.
"You're right, China's economy won't collapse - not alone, that is. China as a whole will collapse.

It's not the Chinese economy that is China's big problem - the economic difficulties are just a symptom. There's three problems, only one of economic nature, that China has: demographics, the type of government and the middle income trap. Each one individually could be overcome, but all taken together create the perfect storm - a storm so bad that it's difficult to make any kind of prediction, other than that it will be very bad.

China's population will decrease - to half of what it is now until 2050, there's no question about it. Not even the Chinese government disputes this. China's recent 3 children per family policy can't help - Chinese people don't make children because it's extremely difficult to raise them. For many, even a single child is too much. The Chinese state, at least so far, has failed to create any incentives to make more children. This means that a few decades until now China's population will not be just much smaller, but also extremely aged.

An aged population isn't a problem per se. People can be very productive up into their 80s - if they have access to the right jobs. That's where the middle income trap comes into play. China's economy lives off manufacturing. The real estate sector is just a way to run the money so it eventually is pocketed by the Chinese state. However, manufacturing requires a young, physically fit population. Older people, who had time to accumulate a lot of knowledge and experience, thrive in Western economies in the tertiary sector - services with high added value, not based on physical work. That sector is hugely underdeveloped in China.

Of course, over the few decades ahead until China's population will become old and smaller than it is now, China could, in theory, correct that situation, and develop a vast and well functioning sector of high added value services. However, unfortunately for the Chinese people, this possibility is axed in advance by China's political system. China is a dictatorship. In a dictatorship government is exercised by a hierarchy of people bound not to the law but through fealty. A regional party leader can afford to steal from the state, and bully his competitors, up to a certain level, as long as he properly supports the leader above him. The leader above him can only intervene when the stealing becomes to big, and he risks either getting in trouble with _his_ boss or people becoming excessively annoyed and ready to protest openly - no subordinate will risk his hive for a boss who doesn't ""take care"" of his people. This kind of relations has a devastating impact on innovation - which is exactly the area in which services with high added value are developed. No innovative company can emerge in China without local or central government taking notice, and moving to control it. Even if a revolutionary startup takes off, and starts making money, corrupt officials will support the less innovative but more established competitors with better political connections, especially if bribed, causing innovative independent startups to falter. Conversely, with complicity from corrupt officials, in return for fat bribes, sham startups can be created (and are being created) which receive financing from the state specifically to foster innovation, and then go belly up with nobody being held responsible. Therefore, innovation in China is extremely difficult. Large tech companies are only allowed to grow if they're state-controlled, at least through intermediaries, in China. The vast majority of small startups don't even get off before they are killed - corrupt officials see such startups as cows to slaughter, rather than cows to milk. What works, and will keep working, are low added value businesses in manufacturing.

That's the picture of China in 30 years from now: an excessively aged population, with lots of rather poorly paid jobs for young, physically fit people only and not much place for aged experts. That's not a collapse. That's an extinction."
"Ok, I think you could have just said in a 30 second video that Chinas economy won't collapse because communism and saved everyone."
Day ruined
One other factor that will allow China to avoid a collapse. They have only a 30% debt to GDP ratio and a the Chinese government owns enterprises with a total value of over $60 trillion. Thus they can afford a missive bailout if need be and can maintain their economy by selling off assets for decades if required.
This makes me a sad panda :(
great video
"I feel this is a light overview and doesn't also show the deeper issues. There is a lot more than just the housing market and covid restrictions going on. This covers 60% of the issues and not the other 40%, such as floods, droughts, scam culture, and corruption."
Propaganda. Chinese bots out here force feeding us these videos lol üòÜ
"You are correct!
However, the people are very pissed. And with a dictatorship like the CCP the economy won't collapse because of monitary loss, but because the people decide they can't take the hammer anymore. Now, as we've seen with  Tianmen square, they will quiet the populus up without much hassle, but the Information will leak out to the world faster than before. Once enough people stand up around the world - it will change. One day the regime will collapse, just probably not In  20 days haha"
wait. double 3 or double 4 has exactly the same probability as double 6.
"I agree with this assessment of china's current problem. However, I think he is giving too positive an impression of stagnation coupled with depopulation. I think China is going to collapse on the about 49 year time-line not days, along with Japan and a few other countries."
"Peter Zeihan, he's one of those morons who keeps on repeating this crap every few months or so. Also, but to a lesser extent, he saying the  same about Europe. Basically, he saying every continent will go down, deteriorate while at the same time the US will go up into the stratosphere on all fronts."
How much?
I think you are right. We will probably get a slow decline over the decades from China.
WION left the chat
What a pity!
"Economy won't dissolve into nothing, but the infrastructure will."
So you don't dispute the facts. You just don't think it will be that bad... üòê
I wonder how many chinese bots liked this video... I feel its in the 10k.. heh
"Rolling double anything on two dice has the same odds. Rolling 2 3's is NOT more likely than 2 sixes. That was a really bad analogy. It's all the same odds. 
Rolling a 2 or a 12 is less likely than rolling a 3 or 11(total) because there is 1 combination that totals 2 or 12 vs 2 combinations for 3 and 11. Just so we're clear."
"That was an excellent exegesis‚Ä¶..  it does remind me of the adage ‚Äúno plan survives first contact with the enemy‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  Thomas Jefferson famously held dinners where he invited a wide cross section of disciplines, he did not think a man well rounded who was not versed on art, economics, agriculture etc‚Ä¶ which brings me to your piece‚Ä¶..   you comment on stability of China v United States‚Ä¶.. a country that fell into civil war in the last 100 years, and had the great cleansing, re-education camps, rolled tanks over its own citizens‚Ä¶.. the very act of Covid Zero Policy is unstable‚Ä¶‚Ä¶¬†

in your home‚Ä¶. Your hot water tank has a T&P valve‚Ä¶. When the temp rises and the pressure builds & the valve releases keeping your house from blowing up‚Ä¶.. now the US does seem unstable‚Ä¶.

Thumbnails always have alarmist titles as clickbait.  The fact is that the Chinese economy is starting into a new phase where it will no longer be a good place for foreign investment.
Exactly right! It won't collapse. It cannot. Even if the govt runs out of money. Because they can simply take money from all its people. Something the rest of the world is unable to do
"Totally logical and well thought out video, definitely good to see someone address the unusual and sensationalistic Chinese collapse video trend on YouTube, it's almost like they're being churned out by a video farm."
"Japan style stagnation was done intentionally by the Japanese central bank at the behest of the americans.  Japan couldn't get out after that is all.  even in the last 12 months, japan just committed economic suicide to help the american economy."
"I agree, no collapse or
Full recovery is likely as the government is desperate to avoid to avoid social chaos and have some stability and there is monetary policy freedom to work with but longer term issues will be kicked down the road to suit the elite. So just about will dons to stay afloat but stagnation will be an issues in the medium to longer term"
"I think that even if China locks down the currency inside their borders, it won't help that nobody will want their currency"
What a sober analysis.  How dare you.
"Just like fuison energy, China's economical collapse always seems 30 days away."
So housing prices won't fall all arou d the world :(?
"You didn't mention the Morgage crisis and pushed hard the Chinese line that everything is fine this is just a rough patch, which leads me to believe you're a paid Chinese asset."
"People have been publishing books about china's collapse for many decades, new books come out every year, it is a popular topic with certain target customers.
People are not wise enough to realize that maybe it is fake, or they are simply enjoying the delusion"
nation with a record breaking trade surplus gonna collapse. something with an IQ will know the answer lol
Deeply appreciate this insight coming from an academic in macroecons and international business. Keep at it!
How much money you get from ccp
"The capital control in China are very interesting though I‚Äôm not sure these can really prevent capital flight. International money laundering schemes have been used to get around capital controls in the past, and the volumes of trade between China and the west makes these schemes even harder to detect. It‚Äôll definitely be interesting to see what happens though."
"I think you missed how complicated chinas banking system is, and there lies the ticking time bomb, it's up to ccp either control the coming fall of small banks, but if its uncontrolled then there is good chance for chain reaction."
"It's more similar to the Tokyo bubble. It'll never recover to their growth levels of 7, 8, 9% annually.
Furthermore, speculative investments that made China so attractive to investors last decade won't be as attractive now that the Government has more control over the market. The Party will be the rich and the non - party Chinese will be the newly formed surf class with lesser chance to make it than the U.S. 
On the media, you'll continue to watch how much China has change, or since this recent property collapse things have slowed but still has some opportunity, themed; like yourself. In reality, China has been entering into a haves and have nots political class separation."
"eesh hard to see how ""permanent stagnation"" is ""learning the lesson from the Great Depression"""
Finally some sense
Actually this ‚ÄòChina is collapsing‚Äô narrative has already been around for ages. Somebody(forget about his name but he was on a interview with MSM not long ago) wrote a book about how China would collapse 20 years ago. And it‚Äôs still on sale on Amazon with a fairly high rating. People just keep bringing this up whenever it‚Äôs convenient. It‚Äôs understandable that people feel better in hard times when knowing others doing worse. That‚Äôs why China will keep collapsing and collapsing for centuries to come.
I guess we‚Äôll see in 25 days. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"So many fallacies in this video. First of all; the 3 red lines were implemented as the housing bubble was getting out of hand (ghost cities/speculation/over-leveraged mortages), yes. What that has now led to is negative equity, a 12 months decline in housing prices and people's paper money being evaporated. A domino effect has ensued. 
The Chinese government does NOT value stability. It values POWER. Why do you think it went after the ANT group? The education sector? The gaming sector. POWER is key. 
Their manufacturing sector is also collapsing. They may account for 1/5 of all manufacturing in the world, but how does that work out when factories and SMEs are closing down? China is looking towards an INWARD policy (Xi's latest speech) - You should probably check that out after reading this comment. 
Problem is that with a slowdown, with a population that ""lies flat"" and ""rotten tail properties"", you simply cannot ""boost"" trust by pumping money into the banks and trying to lend out to the already collapsing property bubble."
"Mate China has already collapsed. The power is off, companies collapsing, they have run out of money. Corruption is rife. The situation is terrible"
I thought this guy was pretty good until the end when he made the ridiculous statement that a double six at dice is less likely than a double five or double four. if his understanding of probability is so poor don't give anything he says any credit.
Even Laowhy86 covered how it‚Äôs not gonna crash. Now the ecological disaster right now regarding the rivers and crops.. yeah that‚Äôs something else
"The impact of lockdowns on the economy is overblown. At any time its probably about 0.1% of the population in a lockdown, it's not like 50% of the country can't spend, it's basically negligible."
"Becoz it's easy for them to get $$ from Youtube, so they kept sending those information and remarks out (which is what they are hoping for) - it's about getting money from Youtube really."
"I mean ccp is not stupid, if they were the Kuomintang will stand in Beijing today"
Definitely on the train that China's economy will boom. The only risk to still account for is political risk
"That guy says China's economy will collapse, the other guy says no. What is it now?"
"I never watch your actual videos, I just play the audio thru a Bluetooth headset while I work. Seeing your face and voice at once is messing with my head. Idk why, I thought you were Mexican."
"All i'm hearing is China's avoidance of late stage capitalism will help keep it, and thus major regions it influences, out of absolute crisis."
They will collapse because the leadership is psychopathic authoritarians..
"China will lose it's competitive advantage because it will have to weaken it's currency and that raises it's input costs. Cheap labor is already gone and the only other advantage is lax environmental regulation, but cities are choking on pollution. China is built on leverage more than any other country that ever existed, so its stall speed is much higher."
"A very cogent analysis. Thank you very much.

I think China's economic growth will continue but not at the blistering pace of previous decades. It will still outpace Western economies, however. So, not to worry."
"Double 3 dice is as likely as double 6, or any other double.
Or did he mean hitting any other double other than 6?"

"Finally!!! I‚Äôm so happy that someone is taking about those videos, I‚Äôve literally watched every single one with the ‚Äò27 days collapse‚Äô videos and my frustration kept growing.

"Dude, your scenario is probably likely given the quality of your arguments.  However, I can't begin to explain how disappointed I was that you use dice to explain probabilities and state that double 3's or double 4's are more likely than double 6's.  They're all the same probability man.  1/36."

"Have to disagree with you on this one. China is absolutely crashing. To compound matters their population is one of the oldest in the world, so they don't have young spenders to help speed up the recovery. By 2030 they will be replaced by India as the worlds manufacture hub."
"this is definitely a pro ccp channel. dude your a shill- down with the ccp, down with human rights violations, and to all you bots commenting- the lights are gunna turn off in china in the next 10 years. probably the next 5 maybe even in the next calendar. hope your ready. btw, Tiananmen square was real."

He speaks like a certified wumao.He claims the CCP has enough money but cannot explain why the CCP needs to scam its own citizens on real estate investment.
"What about the UK? Arguably, they're in as bad of a predicament as China?"
"Imo, those ""... will collapse in xx days"" can be pretty much summed up in just a concept: Racism. Whether they talk about Russia's economy and/or military collapse due to the invasion of Ukraine, or China's economy due to this bubble, the Covid infection and posterior lockdown, or a mix of both factors; in the last couple years Internet had been flooded with these kind of videos, and the funniest thing of it is how those predictions not only mostly failed, but some of them (call it effects of Covid pandemic to China, call it effects of the sanctions against Russia) even backfired in some degree (see, for instance, how accute was the impact of Covid in many western countries, or the effects of the economic sanctions against Russia... In Western Europe). And I can't find a more coherent explaination to those failed predictions, than Europe and US' blatant racism and severly biased views and analysis."
"Yeah, but don't you think you could get a lot more views and clicks by naming the video ""China's economy is SELF-DESTRUCTING!! HERE is what YOU need to KNOW!"""
"As much as I agree that Chinese decline will be slow it will happen nevertheless. China is not monetary independent, it is dependent on energy imports (contrary to Russia) and thus dependent on $. 
And while it has learned the lesson of great depression, it has not learned the lesson of central planning failure."
"They said the same thing about Russia, I wonder how much of this is a natural conclusion or a pushed narrative and by who?"
I deliberately didn't click on them because it's so obviously clickbait.
"Thanks for calling these guys out. China is probably heading for economic hardships in the short term, and possibly even a major recession, that does not mean economic collapse.

"While I agree with the conclusions reached in the video generally, I think you over value the likelihood of a sustainable economic recovery. Personally, I think it is more possible than collapse, but your conclusion about a stagnation/slow recovery period is more likely. However, there are two details that I feel have also been ignored that will significantly impact the chances and success of any recovery: 1. Growing international tension over China's aggressive position vis Taiwan, and 2. the ""on shoring"" or ""re shoring"" of manufacturing capacity out of China back to other countries. Both will likely cause swings in the Chinese trade surplus over the next decade which can severely slow economic recovery from a major bubble like this."
thank you I was waiting for a video like that!
"I knew it china economy can't never be collapsed 
All china hater making china economy collapse video especially cow worshiper Rendian (India)"
"According to western media's economic experts china's been collapsing/stagnating/declining since almost 2008. in a few years we'll be saying the same but with YouTube's economic ""experts"""
Here is a crazy ass news flash. None of these you tubers know anything lol they all feed off each orher and make videos based on what gets the most clicks genes why he is making this video. He makes videos with an opposing view on videos that got a lot of clicks. His facts are based on nothing more than just opinion based on a opposing view and nothing more. He gives no original facts or true insight. All his facts are basic news fed articles and basic knowledge. Lol you guys are sheeps just take the news and form your own opinion like this guy did
Finally someone said it. I was so sick and tired of the China economy will colapse in xx days. I want to make some bets with all those other youtubers
"Ah thank you.
Finally someone who is speaking sense. 
They have barley Done any QT also so They have some bullets left in the chamber.
Also Evergrand has been going on for over one year, Sozz so boring by now."
"This video is making way too much sense, holy shit."
Hitting any double numbers with 2 dice has the same probability though..
i mean you can dream right?
"While all eyes are on China, mostly the American ones,  it is its neighbor immediately south of it, India, that everybody needs to be worried about. India is sitting on a debt volcano has none of the Chinese advantages."
"Who's to say that popping the bubble yourself is actually going to help out that much. Learning your lesson is not getting into it in the first place. China has not learned the lesson. It just has slightly different options, and it's only getting out better insofar as the rest of the world does a lot worse."
"maybe not an imminient collaps but a bleak future. Here is why: 
(1) Real Estate:  There is no easy solution on real estate. It is a gigantic mess with tons of vested interest. This video assumes that you can just bail out the sector's debt and move on. The comparison with the US is utterly uselss. The crux in the chinese RE is that the entirety of state funding requires on land sales with high values, each in turn guaranteed by a massive shadow banking debt system. This is not a stock issue (like debt in the US subprime crisis), but a flow issue. To continue, China needs to build ever more units at ever higher prices ever more distance from city centers in ever more cities. Combine this with a rapidly falling population over the next years and the fact that the population caught up to the fact the real estate is no longer a ""risk free"" investment and you have a gigantic loop crisis that is not comparable to any western counterpart. Xi knows this, which is why he tries this piecemeal approach, but he waited too long. A bailout will not solve this at all, but worsen the effect soon after as the construction industry needs to be rightsized today. (if not too late already)
(2) GDP numbers: It is well known that these are not worth the pixels they are printed on. Even China's own premier doesn't take them seriously. The massaging is mainly done by underestimating inflation and misreporting imports and exports with political careers tied to the number. Historically not the biggest issue as the trajectory was going up. The effects are becoming clearer
(3) Aging: China's population declines since this year at a speed that no country has ever experienced. Even faster then Russia. This creates a workers, pension and healthcare issue at the same time. 
(4) Dictatorship: China's main strength was it's weird form of changing the top brass. Every 10 years the leader got kicked out via a competitive (though undemocratic) system of profiling a strategy. Xi is politically strong by force, but on all other accounts the weakest leader China has ever seen. he has failed to address any of the looming issues in housing, demographics, social security and health care. The correct strategy would be to boot him out and replace the top brass. The November congress will most likely install more loyalists and extend his term with the blind leading the blind. That is the main reason why a collapse is likely as nothing will be seriously reformed."
China thanks you for your service
U know China owns the US by now. lol
"Great Point. It was because of that that I didn't clicked any of those baits. China is not a democracy. The party can approve or dismantle any law by the second they agree.
I just hope there is no fumbling of power inside the party, as it gives no chance for someone not moderate enough to deal with Taiwan could spark major conflict in the area."
"i think the big thing here, is that everyone in china uses real estate as their investments instead of stocks... so if the price of real estate crashes, that means everyone who has spend hundreds of thousands on houses that are rotting, have lost their money forever. i dont think this will cause a ""collapse"" but it will definitely piss a ton of people off, the bubble has to pop eventually."
"Yeah, I'm 35 and they've been predicting Chinas collapse roughly every 4 months for my entire life. But every 4 months, they forget the last time they said it."
I think it's just about views maybeüôÇ
It is just americans coping from the reality that there is little hope left for their economy.
"Due to the amount of Chinese bots in the comments this feels like CCP paid promotion. Reminder to free democratic people of the world, CCP is your enemy, it's directly against democracy, it's the very same government that few decades ago has slaughtered millions upon millions of people by withholding food during famine, and then massacred thousands of young and bright students protesting in tianmen square"
presents a counterview. Sheep: that‚Äôs against my fantasy how much they bribe you omg?!
"China is rotting from within, they may be a manufacturing powerhouse today, but watch that drop through the floor as Chinese citizens age and cannot work.  Then the one child policy has one person providing care for two elderly parents.   Good luck with you manufacturing.

Though, china is also developing their slave labor markets from Falun Gong and the Uyghur Muslims, so that might offset the population problem.  It's a dark time for Asia."
Your dice analogy is really bad. It's just as likely to roll double fours or fives than it is to roll double sixes. Basic probability!
I also belief that China won't collapse if the economy does it could still life on with a North Korean style economy
"For admin chanel..please explain to me...how china can keep their product cheap....is it dumping option.
Or devaluate yuan..if its so inflation should be higher than 5 persen
Please tell me
Terima kasih"
I kinda like this take. Most other take make China look like their house is burning and doing nothing while in reality China would do everything in its power to put out the fire or atleast control it
how much CCP pay your for this?
lekker bezig
robbery is what the ccp is doing of course they will be fine for now
Reguardless still hope that China burns but your video is very rational and I respect how you have pointed out the facts
"A bail out via ""money printing"" of the central bank will lead to inflation in China as well. Maybe not collapse, but stress and social unrest for sure."
Correct
The drought in China will cause significant economic problems for them.
"Someone needed to make this video. Even if we're against the Chinese, then cleareyed assessment of their situation is a necessity."
"The world's largest dictatorship regime has crippled its finance, education, IT, e-commerce sector through targeted efforts and Covid-zero, vows to start a war against every single one of its neighbours, and is facing the worst drought in at least one hundred years, creating the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. And this guy says its economy will be okay and 14000 people agree. This is gold."
"I thank you for this perspective. It is different from the others. But I feel like you forgot to mention other factors that could potentially weaken your optimistic take. Such as the let it rot movement. They're already going to experience a population decline, but also the current youth are refusing to work, so there will be a sever labor shortage surely? And that would greatly impact the economy. Along with their electrical issues, idk. It seems it's going to be worse than what was said in the video."
"Ppl forget China's got a fail-safe built into the system: at the end of the day, they can just send goons to your house and force you to do whatever yhey want."
"fucking jackass, nibiru is coming so everything will crash, everywhere....go read a fucking book...its 115 degrees in china...and paris....and canada...go read a fucking book...fuck china"
Que Chinese propaganda
And the comments and viewers are buying up these clickbaity videos like no tomorrow lmao. It's straight up propaganda
So how much they pay you for this?  And I dont mean you tube
I think China is in pretty bad shape because it's not just the property bubble but also the bullet trains are running into major debt as well sort of like the property bubble and I know they lie about their inflation they say it's only gone up by 2.2% but they don't include the price of food or energy and I have heard that the price of pork over in China has 20x  its original price and they have rolling blackouts and they don't through a major drought what is also affecting their electricity I personally believe there in a Downward Spiral and I know they're young citizens because of the covid lockdowns I'm getting really angry about it and it's causing civil unrest
"Finally, someone who instead of making sensationalist videos actually makes something based on logic, events and similar scenarios, new sub!"
How much money did you get from china ....this video is pure non sense .....
Its so dumb watching those videos claiming how China will implode for some reason. Its so stupid
"Yes the propaganda is literally unbelievable,well pay the trillion dollars back the USA owes them,ask these channels to ask them to pay the .money back"
"The hero we needed! 
I clicked on one freakin video and the Great and Holy Algorithm decided I needed my recommendations flooded. I take anything like that with a grain of salt but man it is hard when you‚Äôre not educated on the topic."
I mean this video is pretty much entirely speculative as well. Your opinion on the situation is no more valid than the other people talking about it no? Why are they preventing people from withdrawing money?
They are American YouTube channels full of bullshit! China is doing well!
"Everything is so good there that rolling back-outs, covid lockdowns and factory shutdowns are all part of a 5D Chess in a multiverse simulation. Human factor is decisive in politics, just look at Russia, on paper they were a super duper hyper military juggernaut, but reality is a bisss"
"They will make those 29 days....videos each month, and in the event China does collapse, they will send you a profound, ""I told you so"""
Pretty sure the whole world economy is colapsing
It's sad
in 2005 when I was in University by Economics teacher used to say that within 20 years the Chinese government will gradually aim for a slower growth in the economy as they try it manage it better. A 'cooling' off of the 30 year+ mega growth. They are just going with the plan idiots
"While a Japan Stagnation might be more possible, the biggest problem would be for the CCP itself. Since they side with the banks and the banking System is way more fragmented than in the US, that means its harder to bail out, because of that. And i heard that some of the reason the baks cannot give back the money is, bacause they broke the law and gave it away. Yet another reason why the pepole would be unhappy, now combined with the new ""Lazy"" Generation, were the ""let it rot"" symptome is present, i dont think pepole will take a liking to the CCP. So i think it would be a Political crash befor a economic collaps, by the way i understand it. But i dont think China has a chance to get out of the hole so to speak.
Political crash or a Economic collaps is the way and since the pepole that sit in the CCP would not like to stop ruling the country, they are going to burn it to the ground until they burn themselfs, but even 30 days collaps is WAY too optimistic about the collaps"
Finally someone with educated news and opinion.
Yes makes more sense. I‚Äôve watching about China‚Äôs impeding down for a decade. It‚Äôs just over dramatisation for views.
China will not collapse. They have more industrial capabilities then any country in the world. The Chinese and western economies are so tightly connected we need each other to be successful.
"Very interesting video! 
On a side note: you might want to adjust your back posture :D"
"Sensationalist youtubers aside, China is not USA, exactly! China is heavily dependent on export, the world is more and more turning towards a recession. In EU we are seeing higher energy prices every day and winter is yet to come = reduced spending. All mayor tech companies are facing reduced sales now and expect sales decrease coming months/next year. -tech sector is often least/last effected by recession. -> lowered Chinese production. 
China has mayor drought in the south and mayor floods in the north->failing crops = food price increase/more import, energy problems and price increase, 0-covid-lockdowns = production problems, housing bubble with China not being USA in that, the housing sector/Chinese economy is the primary investment tool for many citizens. Next with its banking scandals (and corruption in every level of government and business). = Destabilizing the CCP.
Apple moving more production outside of China isn't troublesome in numbers for china as a whole, but Apple more often then not a market maker. What apple does, many others copy, not just the products :)
China can print more money, but it would devaluate RMB, making import more costly (energy/food) Germany is expecting to increase energy expenditure from 1% to 8% of GDP, it would increase export more, but not with a worsening economy. 
And the CCP is a central government but, as shown with the banking scandals, are not really concerned with people losing money, and initially didn't want to cover the costs.  
Instead of helping people they hired thugs to disperse the crowds. 
And being China we don't really know how bad things really are, numbers have always been inflated to hide problems, when they do admit lower growth numbers: shit has hit the fan.  
CCP = losing grip = more hostile, just to galvanize the population, it might not go bankrupt but crazy times ahead.."
Nice to see a voice that is not bulding unrest. Thank you for that.
+10 social credit
"Yeah frankly I was getting sick of it, even channels I had a bit of respect for were pulling this nonsense.  Laowhy86 and SerpentZA have been level headed as well."
Not mentioning the highspeed trains that lead to nowhere that might even be a bigger problem for the commies in charge.
"They have been saying that for years that China""s economy will colappes! But the opposite is happening! It is US & EU's economies are collapsing!"
This whole china collapsing bullshit was first propogated by an indian channel called thinkschool. They're a channel that mainly has  propoganda mixed with business and economic studies!
So many factors are left out. Expecting the government to bail out all the banks puts the country in a lot of debt which has further impacts on the economy of China.
"I would just put a slightly lower probability no the japan scenario for a few reasons.

Part of japan's survival and stagnation is that it relies on a select group of very productive export companies which allows it to offset its stagnating domestic sector. While this allows it to survive, it also creates a entreched groups conglomerates that they can't remove. 

China knows this and wants the former without the latter, this is partly the reason for the crackdown on the tech sector(the educational sector was due to trying to disarm the arms race between parents) and they have also been encouraging smaller rivals to the reigning giants to expand

So to me the more slightly probable outcome is a sort of internal fragmentation of dominant firms which might mean it crashes harder in the short term but might have lesser stagnation"
Finally someone bringing some sense to this topic.
What is the difference in probability of hitting a double 6 as compared to a double of any other number on dice. The comparison in the last part of the video is lost on me for this reason
Very knowledgeable on the matter
"Don't they also have like.. all the important resources the rest of the world wants? I mean lots if not most of rare earth materials? Besides that they have plenty of people, land and money. If anything they're in a pretty good position economically."
"My YouTube has been under absolute assault of these videos in the past month. 
Started checking their other videos - seems like US and EU economies are just fine.

Looks like a collective hit piece now, but what do I know"
"from my perspective in Hong Kong, I believe the Chinese Economy would survive, but the government's situation is a lot more dire."
"As long as western banks give credit lines and allow the Chinese to issue bonds for the public to buy, China will always abuse and move the goalposts to conceal how bad their economy is. Just like their buildings, ready to crumble at the slightest disturbance. Any channel that comes to a nation like China's aid is always a communist funded mouthpiece. Western investors are stupid, they will buy shit from China and convince themselves and others that it is gold. If you came to your senses and stopped nourishing a hostile nation which is using many ways of subverting and demoralising your people (The USA, Europe)."
"Ridiculous logic. 
What makes you conclude that hitting double six is less likely than double five or four? I'm baffled. Was that some kind of smart sarcasm I'm too dumb to understand?"
"China's economy is collapsing!
Russia is about to break apart and will go bankrupt soon!
USA is on the verge of civil war!
Europe is crumbling!"
"My favorite fucking video is the one that says 'A WELL KNOWN-AND RESPECTED FINANCIAL ADVISOR WAS QUOTED SAYING...'

Like... that's it. That's the citation. Just a well known and respected advisor. It could be his dad or his dog. Nobody in particular."
It might stagnate....
"Then, just buy chinese last."
"Dude! We need to save China against Lu Yi, the bank mafia."
Button your top button!?
"Your right....it's probably going to be a lot worse than the great depression. At least the US could still feed itself during the 30s, where china is about to starve."
Is your ph D in underwater basket weaving since you sound like someone holding up a ponzi scheme.
"6:19 gives the biggest argument against his own hypothesis. The US was able to bail out banks and justify that action as the global currency. This scenario will solidify the yen as useless, just like Russia ""stabilizing"" its economy is a scam, because the rubble is also now useless. Exports are nice but they don't make a country a superpower, investors do. Keeping your money locked in your county also shows lack of faith in your own currency, and add to that the fact that China refuses to allow external auditors evaluate their finances. This video is more like China sympathy rather than rational analytics."
"I‚Äôm shorting China and is going good, rather have the economy collapse"
"I'm looking at the charts around the 2 minute mark, and i don't quite get the claim of these being similar situations - the Great Depression sees a 4x rise in 5 years, the Great Recession a 100% increase, while China has, like, +25%. Is this even a concern in the first place?"
"This month I started watching a lot of  Leftist content on YouTube and suddenly I was bombarded whith ""China is collapsing "" videos .
I wonder why . ?"
"Liked and subscribed. Fascinating analysis, thank you"
"This entire video idea is that the economy will not crash because Chinese state owns a lot of things, and it will bail them all out (by printing infinite money).
That is complete economic illiteracy.

The reason western economies leave their economy to crash (readjust would be the correct term) is because in a crash, the inflation comes back to normal.

Otherwise, if you just keep printing money to bail out everyone, the inflation explodes into 2 and 3 digit numbers which leads to inflation seen in Venezuela and other third world countries which is even worse than a crash."
"yes, I still keep those ""China doomed count down"" channel links, and I'm gonna go back to see what they will say after, or maybe not, I know they will put on another new count down video."
The thing is.... the vast majority of finance Youtubers have very much idea about the finance industry or world economies.  That just regurgitate fake-news that they've seen elsewhere with little understanding.
The command control forms of capitalism just dont work. Sorry. They sort of worked when the West was the only consumer (again propped up by shady social democracy) but Russias drive to multi-polarise the world economy WILL lead to the emergence of pure free markets (we may not like what we see but multi-polar worlds are competitive worlds) and we will definitely see China assume more Japan like proportions (just as Japan suffered that fate when China rose to replace it.)
"The mouse will not explode. I repeat, the mouse will not explode."
"Correct on all points,  but then doesn't printing money in these quantities cause inflation?"
Low birth rates and central banks will turn all major economies into Japan eventually that goes for China bad the U.S so dumb.
Ohh yeah they've got Plenty of food and cheap energy.
"They've been predicting China's ""collapse in 10 years"" since the 1990s."
"It won't happen *as* fast as people are trying to lead us to believe, but it *is* an inevitability at this stage that China's economy will eventually fail."
"As much as it's true or not I can take this for granted.
China isn't in the best situation economically, it's not the end at all, just a bad sitback.
If all the publicity of imminent economical collapse of China, actually damages it to some extent (which is not farfetched).
I'm more than okay."
Thank you!
Considering China is an authoritarian nation that controls everything it's laughable to think it would collapse like this lmao. Heck even NK is afloat.
"I've seen atleast 3 videos about ""China's collaps in 50 days"" every year since I've started using YouTube"
Only time will tell.
"Hey, who things this guy is being paid by the stupid Chinese Government.  You know, the China we all know that keeps slave works, who leaders like to have sex with 14 girl, so they make laws that make this crap legal.   
The CCP is a EVIL abusive government that needs to be wiped off the face of the planet!!!!!"
"It helps to have a billion hard working people creating real wealth too. They have some economic pain to go through, but they will right the ship. Holding my positions, thinking 2-3 years should put them back on track. Geopolitical risks are the X-factor in my opinion. Thanks for the sanity !"
Well that's good to hear but tell me if I'm wrong.. a Japan style decline is pretty bad too..
"China no longer has a one child policy, people can have as many children as possible"
"I am not sure about your statement that most banks in China are state-owned, only 6 banks are state-owned. Sure they are the biggest ones but they only account about half of all Chinese bank assets. I am not sure about collapse but I live in China and it's very noticeable, people are worried and nobody wants to spend money right now. Factories and stores are closing in droves."
"Another thing to note is that while in the US an economic crisis comes as a sour surprise of a failure of the market to sustain itself without intervention, in China this development is by design. A central part of how China resolves issues and develops itself is by ""unleashing the forces of production"" and letting them run their course. Along with the benefits of production, this causes contradictions/tensions within their society and economy and reveals how to resolve them. Since this development is not only within expectations, but the very goal itself, they of course have already prepared for what to do when it arrives. Another noteworthy fact is a technicality which turns out to be very significant in this case in particular: their housing market, although ""unleashed"", is actually laid on the foundation of public housing. This means that the Chinese government can regulate real estate prices directly if needed, which might be their trump card. All in all I am not convinced they will see much of a recession at all over this."
"Thanks for the video, I don't know much about economics so I was slightly being drawn in by the clickbait, although I was skeptical, to hear the other side is quite important."
"Logical and simple to understand arguments, subscribed!"
Authoritarianism vs Democracy is totally irrelevant to economics. How stupid are people to relate these two issues?
Chinese bots are after me so please like this video on everyone of the sensationalist video which helps it spread. Please like this comment Chinese bots are after me
Ironically the west is the one teetering on the edge if collapse right now.
It's information warfare.
"I think the Japan style slowdown is correct, though Michael Pettis has some goods stuff about how we should rethink China's trade surplus."
"can you do a video on how to avoid sri lanka type economy collapse and if so what are the solutions that's on the table,
can IMF bailout can save sri lanka, or it just a another ""interval in hell""?
looking forward for a video."
1/36 chance of the world's largest economy collapsing is still pretty scary... üò≥
"Wow you a pro communis... get lost DEMOCRACY DOESN'T NEED COMMUNIS IN FACT IT MUST BE DESTROY FROM THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE"
"Please do a video on the risks to EU economy from their energy policy, with specific attention on risk to interest rates, the ECB policies towards bonds and buying up governmental debt. I follow economist and professor mark blyth, and in some of his talks he outlined how euro block is at risk of collapse due to the above."
"A breath of fresh air, and very well done. Thanks!"
beautiful. someone who can actually explain economics that isnt american liberal capitalism.
"Maybe it won't collapse but i sincerely hope that we (""West"") stop fuelling its degenerative political regimen."
"dunno if its just me and my sensitive ears but your mic seems to be having some problems, it would be a good idea to take a look at that and see if its fixable"
You have been pre approved for 200 social credit.
"In other words, it'll be bad, but probably not THAT bad."
"China government controls 1.4 billion slaves, it won't collapse until running out of slaves"
"So how come the Chinese didn't stop Evegrade even though they were well aware of the bubble, IF they don't need the robbed money of their citizens? And HOW COME the Chinese government ask their own citizens to fuel the bubble further, IF they don't need to rob their own citizens? These two are clear indicators of a huge problem."
"The economy will be fine, The people on the other hand...."
"You're explaining economics, yet you say getting a 6x6 dice throw is less likely than a 3x3, or 4x4, or 5x5... They're the same probability.
Simple statements like that make one question the credibility of your statements and research. I liked most of the video, learnt something, and can't dismiss that. Just hoping you learn more economics and mathematics. Makes your content more credible."
"I'm thinking a little out of left field here, because of china's big population, i think that mother nature could be what may cause the biggest problem for china ?"
"If you live and work in China, you know the situation is not good and many people cut spending and are saving massively at the moment. In many Tier 2 city the house price is dropping this is a fact. People selling for cash. Businesses are under stress because of the regular lockdowns. It is no use to start a gym, restaurant or other physical store when these things happen. People demand money back they pay schools when another 3 weeks in lockdown. So this put stress on the owners.  They are losing a lot and dont even know if they will survive now. These are facts what no youpooper is talking about it is just clickbait same stuff. But real stuff is not documented, because they dont live here"
Finally someone who isn't funded by US government!
I figured it was too good to be true.
I love western projection hmmm yummy
"As someone who watched many of those videos I was allways asking myself, ""How does this representa colapse"" like they described a crises but talked about it like it was the end of China. Some even said ""China will colapse in 1 month""  3 months ago"
ever since the 2016 elections i've become enlightened that almost everyone lies on youtube & in real life so i don't trust anything but cute animals
Graham Stephens is a fear mongering dork.  He works for the banks
"Just a question, how can we talk logic with a Dictator?"
"You know westerners have being saying china will collapse since forever, nothing new here."
the bot game is strong with this one
China and Russia are winning. The west is losing.
"the thing is, china has a lot of problems, demographic changes (far more men than women because of the one child policy), societal changes/unrest, their economic problems, climate change problems, and a lot more. I think it is basically impossible to make accurate predictions for chinas future, since everyone of these problems is solvable, with the right leadership. But all together might strain the capabilities and the will too much. I still think IF chinas economy would ""collapse"", it would happen in at least a decade. A more realistic scenario is probably a harsh stagnation (as with japan), or a big shrink, but not a total collapse (and even this i expect to take a lot of time).

PS: thanks for being a voice of reason in this age of click-bait..."
I honestly think you missed the point by trying to compare China was Sri Lanka there or not like it all and I also don‚Äôt believe that comparing this to the great depression and then using those characteristics to disprove or say that the cops is not coming doesn‚Äôt make sense because nobody else is making those connections with you
"yeah, these video's are going crazy, and being recommended like their is no tomorrow...."
So glad to have something sensible rather than explosive and incorrect nonsense
"I think you are right about your prediction of China's future. As you pointed out clearly in your video about Japan, shrinking population contributes to deflation on the longer term. although there is still a lot of reserve in Chinese labor, (close to 300 million people do not have permanent employment) this will have an impact. furthermore it will be more and more expensive to keep order in the country which costs money. they have a huge wealth gap."
True
"A couple of points. 
1. China is in charge of the banks. Endless cash to pay out?  Then why are they stopping a bank run? 
2. If property prices come off 20 to 50% below what has been borrowed then who in their right mind will maintain their mortgage? 
3 part of a downturn in property is exasperated by people waiting to find the bottom. Which puts more downward pressure. 
I'm not sure who is right or wrong but I don't think they are in a great position."
"This guy assumes a government can print paper money forever with no effect . China helped keep the world economy afloat in the 2008 USA recession which he didn't seem to mention. 
 No one knows exactly how this will play out but I think people are in denial if they think any government can magically stop ""reaping what we sowed"" that being building  for decades now."
"Lol, you guys don‚Äôt know how economics work. Keep dreaming."
Finally someone who thinks. Some logic in this shit show of catchy titles
"Thanks for bringing this up. Finally, we need to understand that a country so large with some of the smartest economists working for them, a country this large and powerful cannot just collapse like this in a few months or even years. It would take way longer than this unlike some YouTubers are claiming for more views."
You should have addressed more competent arguments such as those of Peter Zeihan
Why is hitting double 6 less likely than double 3 ???
Finallyyy!! I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to step up and put an end to this China clickbait wave that the big finance youtubers are feeding off. Thank you üôè
Logical and independent reasoning!
"The funny thing is with so many PRC\CCP trolls and pro China fanatics out there I doubt any one defending this vile regime.
However, my feeling is the people posting crap saying China is about to crash, are probably rubbish and this post has good factual ground.
I still wish the PCR would fall apart and democratic countries avoid it like the Orwellian style nation it is."
Finally someone with some common sense
The fact that all of these videos used the exactly same rhetoric is actually super suspicious.
My hat off to you - someone who is sensible enough to talk about the economy with some sense. China doom day critics have been around for the past 25 years and never have they been accountable for their wrong predictions about China's growth yet they still keep doing it without sign of relentless. In the meantime China keeps growing and growing and China somehow finds to improve because they learned from the mistakes made by the West. What the author so rightly pointed out is the current property market crash is actually caused by the government because enough is enough. Give the property developers free rein and only the rich can afford housing. Houses should be for living and not for speculation.
"1) They don't have a reserve currency like the US (this is a 'big' problem)
2) You can't engineer outcomes (in economic systems or in life)"
"1) They don't have a reserve currency like the US (this is a 'big' problem)

Hitting double 4 more likely than double 6??? Thats not how dice work...
he's Sponsorsed  by the CCP....
China apologist....no one knows the full extent of the contagion of their shadow banking...they are fucked which ever way you look at it.
"Great simple video I like that you're not making grand assumptions. China is definitely in a recession with incredibly high unemployment, wage stagnation, and incredibly high housing prices. But I wonder what your take with inflation since CNY value has fallen 11% in the past 4-5 months from 6.3 to 6.87 to the dollar. Obviously it's not an probably won't spiral down, but how far will the inflation go until things are stable again"

You‚Äôre right China will not collapse if  the US dollar does collapse they will too
"Don't hitting double six, double five, double four and double three have the same probability when rolling two dices?üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
So sick of seeing these videos in my recommended. Just the same video over and over again with more and more clickbaity titles and thumbnails.
"I mostly agree with this with the proviso that it remains a manufacturing centre.  The costs of manufacturing in China are no longer as cheap as they were 15 years ago.  The manufacturing will switch to lower cost centres with smaller supply lines in coming years.  So not days, but maybe years."
"It's all planned by CCP, did this intentionally to take control of the powerful corporate companys and non-govt. banks."
"How have they ‚Äòquite literally run out of steam‚Äô? Steam isn‚Äôt hard to make, it‚Äôs not scarce."
I reported those clickbaits the very first time seeing
"I like your analysis.  The sky is not falling in China, as it is not falling in the USA.  I too see a slow decline due to population decrease, government bailouts (national debt will shoot up), the pullout of foreign investment, as well as a big decrease in exports.  There are plenty of other nations can fill the void of an exporting China, if you look at what they export.  Also, people always seem to miss the problem the CCP has with regional governments on cooperation.  China will still be a powerhouse (especially militarily in the next few decades), but somewhat marginalized by bad policy internally and the building up of bad will toward other nations.  If China became a democracy coupled with a large immigration influx, I believe it could be the world leader."
It achieved this buy an endowment from the USA money equipment then investmen and aid... think they got developing country aid like last yr.... we lost manufacturing cuz we start building factory over there in the 70 and 80 other wise .....
"Finally, someone talking sense. Yes China has a lot of problems, but it is nowhere near total collapse."
Seems likely to me that Chinas stagnation will be very destabilising for a country used to endless growth to justify its regime.
funny if China collapsing as its the only country on Earth with a growing economy
Gordon Chang wrote 'the coming collapse of China' 20 years ago. For better or worse we are still waiting
"When I watched a few of these videos, I was left with a sense that they didn't take the manufacturing into account. Yes, a lot people might lose all their value (tied up in that non-existing housing, or useless existing housing), but as long as the factories churn out goods, and why would they stop, China will still stand. And I see no indications that companies are beginning to pack up and flee more than before, and the national companies obviously won't.

The real question is actually, how much it might hurt external lenders. And I think that might be a lot more than China itself. Because the Chinese government will not cover that, and neither will other governments."
How does providing an endless amount of money to the Chinese bank not cause extreme inflation though? Won't their currency suffer because of this?
China collapse are created by right wing extremise who cries about China on a daily basis then gets anal stretch by the Democrats ü§£ü§£ Trump supporters please tell me why you're still bending over when the FBI are hunting ya white supremacist down? üòÇüòÇ Hilarious! God bless Biden!
"@Money & Marco: 0:56 ""when it enters the great depression""  You lie
China will never go under, it'll gladly start a war to take everyone down with it when it happens to stand on top
China has the #1 population and it'll rebound faster than everyone
There is no problem in China at all; its all western media like your channel to slow China's growth at overcome USA for #1 in the New Era

China can force all countries it trades with to accept Yuan and pay in Yuan like Moscow
Everyone outside China must invest in China when it is at its lowest point so more people can exit with old money
USD won't be the reserve currency when over 25% of the world population stop using it; China can choose not if but when to cut America out of the global trade system when America collapse over its debt"
"you forgot to mention China attitude of bullying everyone. After north Korea, China is most hostile nation on this planet. I'm a foreigner living in China and level of craziness here is unimaginable. Not to mention the hatred towards foreigners."
"I was (kinda) with you until @8:40 you said Russia protected its currencyüòÇüòÇüòÇ Russia simply froze all market trading and made up an FX rate that has nothing to do with market forces. And capital controls? Since when this will save the economy? If there is a debt collapse, it will happen regardless if the money stays in China or not, these 2 are not connected! China overlevereged the economy, the 3 lines should have been imposed 20 years ago, not now that the entire thing started to crumble, plus, real estate is 25% of China GDP, not 7% like the US, so your comparison to the US is flawed. if 1/4 of GDP goes to 0 you can bet there will be a ""collapse"". China can interviene, but with what, with Yuan nobody trusts? What I see is an economic collapse, a war against Taiwan to cover it, sanctions and CCP using the sanctions as a scape goat to impose a full scale diactatorship, no economic growth and recovery can take place under these circumstances."
"China can collapse. If anything evergrande thought is nothing is too big to collapse. Eu can collapse, look at how funerable its economy is with just 2 country in war. Usa can collapse, as we can see nowadays they don't have as many allies or the world as not supportive as they thought. Will any of these 3 giants collapse anytime soon? Obviously no. It will take decades for them to detoriate."
"A lot of this will be decided short term, with the 20th national congress coming in November. Xi will be potentate for life, the kleptocrats under Jiang Zemin will return to power or something wild will happen. What is that wild scenario? A democratic coup. Or maybe civil war in the (second) biggest economy. What will happen mid to long term can only be gauged after that flashpoint."
"LOL there are only 2 types of people who genuinely believes in their heart china's economy is gonna collapse. 1.idiots. you can't do anything against that.  2. People who hate china, and they wanna believe anything negative against china to help them sleep better at night lmao. So chill out bruh. People with just basic common sense would understand, that the US economy is not gonna collapse, nor thus china or india, because a healthy economy would normally face challenges  due to local or international factors, but a thriving economy would stay stagnant, grow, or decline a little bit, but with some policy changes it can recover. It's totally normal. The Lehman brothers caused US recession but they end up alright few years later, china too almost faced that with everglade or something but some policy changes where made to avoid the ripple effect. Now global economy faces covid problems, war, inflammation, gas problems, food supply disruptions etc  but it's all manageable. there would always be a problem. It needs massive catastrophic event to cause global economic collapse like for example overnight every oil and coal in the world disappears LOL. Then that's a problem. World war II or covid lockdowns didn't even destroy international economic system. For external factors it needs massive gov corruption, failure or civil war to totally destroy a countries economy. Heck almost everyone in the west tried to destroy Russia's economy, they felt it but they're still fine. So all this challenges faced by china is very doable. High oil prices, zero covid policy slowed local growth, as biggest exporter they would sure face exports decline due to many countries high inflation problems. but again it's all very doable. So basically i'm talking about the ordinary peope, obviously this so called economic youtuber's or media outlet like wion etc are not idiots, they have there own different reason. For youtuber's it's about it's all about getting views and clicks, a lot of people hate china, so baiting them to click is the biggest motivators. Some of their followers could be those people. So it's just about pleasing them.  It's also similar to pro china video's, it basically click baiting pro china and anti west people. As for media outlets, it's all about anti china narrative. Fox, bbc, cnn, skynews, wion etc it's for their base following. Commonly anti china.  You'll always see pro conservative on fox with no liberal narrative. Liberals are the devil to them. You'll also always see liberal ideology on cnn with conservative as racist. For wion it's all about pro hindu or modi nationalism, they would never ever phrase or put china, pakistan, muslim in a positive manner. That's why a really appreciate few remaining neutral channels."
"so If I understand you correctly. China is indeed in trouble, but you believe it has both; a political system willing to take necessary action, and measures in place already to mitigate it. So it won't suffer as badly as many are predicting? 
That sounds feasible"
"FYI, the odds of roling double 6, 5, or 4 are the same :D"
People should make a moral choice and stop buying Chinese goods.
They would fail but they are communists with over a billion slaves ..... it can not go bankrupt
"The problem for China is that its economy and politics is too centralised. For anyone who's read the Black Swan from Taleb, that simply doesn't work. The world is just too dynamic and too many things change too quickly for one person to be able to manage. Even if they sport a Mao suit! 
I agree that we'll probably see decade(s) of stagnation because of this. That's what happened to the USSR - there was never a crash, it just slowly got poorer and its tech got outdated until people got fed up and took the whole thing down. Unless the CCP change direction probably the same faith awaits China too. Dictatorships seems stable compared to the chaos of democracy until the Black Swan event comes (e.g. Russia seemed stable until it invaded Ukraine) and then they implode. Taleb again!"
that's why I can wondering why these finance YouTubers think china would be screwed. this is only temporary
"I agree with your analysis, China will most likely face a long period of low economic growth"
A chinese plant. 100%
They can‚Äôt make videos without clickbait
"if china manages fine then maybe (MAYBE) westerners can accept that .... maaaaybe... (doubtful), but maybe; they don't know everything, and they could possibly learn something from china. very doubtful, but maybe. but i doubt it"
It's just way more clickbaity to say that China will collapse
Hitting double 5 is just as likely as hitting double 6 :)
üíØ
"Yeah, I believe stagnation like Japan is what may happen her"
Otherwise the people will revolt
"Two major problems with this video:
1. *False Dichotomy.* Either China will face an 'US style' economic crisis or an 'Asian / Sri Lankan style' crisis. Joeri implies that since the China situation doesn't fully match these styles, there is little risk of a proper economic crisis in China. This is just silly.
2. *Ignoring dangers of excessive money printing.* The solution for China is presented here as the CCP just being able to print their way out of trouble. There are issues with printing excessive quantities of money, even if they are not immediately visible. If there were no issues, we can easily take it to the logical extreme and make everyone wealthy by printing limitless amounts.

Does anyone else remember Joeri pushing the 'inflation is transitory' story just about a year ago? Talking about anything remotely relating to supply and demand on goods, but ignoring the supply of money in the system? *Inflation is a monetary phenomenon* as said by the legendary economist Milton Friedman over 70 years ago."
"most of the youtubers are not reporting the facts, they just want views so they can earn money. doesnt matter whether the events are real or not. as long as there are people who is anti china, they will believe it."
Finally - so refreshing from this click bait trash.
China's only advantage is cheap labor nothing else lol
Follow the money. How much CIA and George Soros spent this time? George tried to short HongKong stock exchange twice and been beaten by CCP twice in a role. Ouch
pure non sense
"I went through the doobly-doo‚Äôs of a couple of those sensational vids looking for sources or anything to back up what they‚Äôre saying. All I found was crypto shit and some links for seminars on how to earn $100 an hour.

You on the other hand, put a whole doc together for further reading. 

Nerd."
"You mentioned the one child policy and it will sow the seeds of China's collapse. I completely agree that it will not be overnight. China will grow old before the population grows rich. China and Russia are growing old faster than any other countries in the world. It will not be much longer before India overtakes China as the most populous country in the world
Capital controls is a two way street. Why would I invest in a country if I can't repatriate my profits? Holding debt internally helps a lot, but China is printing money at 2 to 5 time that of the US risking inflation.
China's reliance on overseas energy, except for coal, which has its own problems makes it vulnerable. A supply chain disruption can cause either high prices or even lack of supplies. 
I can go on, but at just about every important variable, China is at the low end depending on Global Order which is reducing as countries realize that they cannot depend on a very tenuous supply chain. I see already more and more products made in other countries as well as the beginning of more locally made products"
"Thank u for informing me about this, tho im a little sad that the economy wont actually collapse"
"Unfortunately anti china propaganda is extremely popular right now, there‚Äôs a lot of cope going on in the west because with each day it‚Äôs becoming more and more obvious that china will 100% forsure surpass the US economy, and the petrodollar is failing with little light in sight
Theres a fat sprinkle of racism in with it aswell, they don‚Äôt want an eastern non white country to be on top, even when their own ‚Äúally‚Äù japan was creeping up on the US economy there was a ton of anti japanese propaganda and racism, the west simply is just incapable of accepting the fact that a non white country whom they consider to be racially inferior can take their place of number 1
China is already miles ahead of the west in many things and is far more prepared for the future such as the climate crisis for example they are the number one developer of renewable energy, has set realistic carbon goals and they are actually acting on those goals rather than virtue signalling like the west, and the world is going to have to rely on a leader to get us out of the climate crisis, US is too busy blowing up countries, burning cities to the ground, they will not be able to be the leader for the 21st century
They can cope all they want and say china is going to fall any day, but the 5000 year old civilization has been through far worse many times thoughout their history, their problems of today are nothing compared to what they‚Äôve been through, on top of that they have an actual competent government thats talks less and works more, same cant be said about the US
So I understand why they love their anti china fantasies so much"
"when will China collapses... a mystery even the great fortune teller, Gordon G. Chang, had trouble to determines when would China collapsed, cheated crumbling 10 years onwards and still growing at fastest pace..."

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd call peter zeihan a ‚Äúsensationalist YouTuber‚Äù. I think an aging labor demographic under 40 years of 1 child policy would deserve more than just a footnote. Here‚Äôs a question what percentage of china‚Äôs GDP is in the housing market?
"the 29 day window is not about the economy, its about a potential war between Taiwan and China, whcih can only happen in April or October due to ideal tides for landing craft, these people are only banking on this prediction."
"The author forgot to mention, that China has few more giant problems:

1) Local authorities are in huge debt
2) Speed railway collapse 
3) Political power transition 

I'm not so sure China will handle it..."
"Housing market in China will and should collapse, but China will survive this. The main question should be how long will it take to recover? 

There will always one side that will benefit in market crash. This is more like a heavy correction. Yea, it will suck for the people in China that bought property within 5 years, but the people that couldn't afford housing (young people) will now have the opportunity to buy. How long the collapse will continue will depends when new home buyers thinks it is a good price for them.

Tier 1 cities will recover the fastest, because population and jobs are there. Tier 2/3 cities population will grow because it will cost less to live.  Rural areas will be easier to move into tier 2/3 cities.

At the end of the day, it all depends when the price is acceptable to individual that wants and able to buy housing in China. That will be the real market price and recover from there. China needs to ensure factors and businesses are running."
Being different isn't enough to avoid collapse my friend. Collapses all happen similarly in different cultures for the same reasons.
"""finance"" ""youtuber"" does anyone take someone serious that has both of those two words applicable as description?"
"I was in large agreement until the end of the video when you mentioned ""Japanese-style stagnation"". I simply don't see anything that would suggest a Japanese-style stagnation in China. First of all, Japan sleepwalked into its ""lost decades"" by always doing too little and too late of what was required. China on the other hand has a result-oriented government that will not let solvable structural issues impede China's growth. But even more importantly, China is simply a different beast compared to Japan. China has a much larger economy and larger internal market while at the same time having a huge population and territory that, despite the incredible growth over the past 40 years, has not yet reached full development."
"I'm sure the Chinese depositors that are unable to get their money out are super glad. For them, the nightmare is real, they are living it. They lost all of their savings, had to face down riot police, get dragged off by plain-clothes military, and tanks rolling up on them. But, don't worry, the CCP will come out of this just fine.. 
True, youtube is a cesspool of content creators begging for clicks, but there is actual news there between the lines. Just separate the activity from the conjecture. Evil Shit. Just as bad as Tiananmen Square"
Could you explain why and how there was a famine in China around 1960 in which more than 30 million people died?
Great video!
"Wow  print more money China ,  hahaha ,  Dont worry that all your  loans  for  so called  Belt and road  ? projects to Countries that are heading into recession - wont be repaid anytime soon ,  Not to  mention  now  some  ? 3,000  plus large companies have left China in just over  two and a half years . dont worry  that people worldwide leaving  Made in China products on the shelf .

But for you that  may well    become  ?  yes  the    D  - word  .  hahahaha  ."
"In the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, my grandfather told me stories of chinese factories literally being shut and mothballed. If china can survive that, it can survive a local bank or large company going bust."
might be important to note that a lot of the sensationalized china commentary has a lot to do with the prior rise in discussion about china's rise to super power-dom and replacing the U.S as the dominant world power (which is unlikely IMO)
This is why I never watch those youtubers especially the 2nd clip. That youtuber all he does is spreading fear and uncertainty
reall well made video but i generally hope and think that china will collapse maybe not this year or maybe in 50 but dictatorships and communist system never works
"I remenber seeing one channel say that china was preparing a surprise nuclear attack against the US...

Like hell no, no one is dumb enough to do a surprise nuclear attack against anyone else"
"if we Chinese don't control population, the world will have food shortage :DDDD we need to be less densely populated like the US to enjoy more space and nature and r sources."
"I agree that Chana is not looking at a total economic collapse. What China might see happen is that the people might start a revolution and the CCP itself may fall as the people are seeing the man behind the curtain. 

Now I do think that the CCP has a pretty good chance of crushing any revolution but Xi may not survive the fallout as I think that he will be blamed for everything to save the CCP from falling. I can see the CCP voting Xi out of office and him being executed soon after. If the Chinese ruling body sees that if they can scapegoat Xi and put an end to any revolution before it starts, I can see that happening."
"I agree, China's economy is built on manufacturing, not service like the United States.  They can survive alone, we cannot. We have to keep buying from them."
"There is no bank run in China (those are not banks). The bubble they just burst represents 10% of their GDP. They keep throwing money and keeping people in their houses.
Do not confuse an economic crisis with an economic collapse. Like a lot of countries from Earth, China will experience a recession. How deep will be is up to their policy. (see Russia)"
I just cant listen to him with that microphone it's a tortue
Laowhy86 had a similar take. Him and serpentza host the china show podcast and provide interesting insight having lived there for 2 decades and marrying chinese women. Would be interesting if yall collabbed.
THANKYOU! All these youtubers saying China is X days away from collapse is nonsense.
"Irreverent, not irrelevant. üòâ"
"Yeah, I was thjikning like, guys, you do realize that such a massive economic block is gonna be more resilient than that, right? üòÇ They're enduring a lot of pain alright, but this is just a slowdown. Also remember that just 10 years after the Great Depression, the US went on to win the biggest war in history, so even such a catastrophic event isn't the end of a country."
Look at all the bots someone is being paid by the ccp
"what about zimbabwe, they printed more money but ended up switching to the dollar. how  can they save themselves, if their money is worth nothing and companies like evergrande keep pulling money out of the economy, creating less trust in the real state market? then account for the people that are doing the bare minimum and refuse to work. but hey lets see if they make it past october"
"FINALLY.......someone busted these ""Clickbait Youtubers"" whose only purpose is to make money from clickbait titles....Hats off to you man."
Why kill the vibe? Many jealous westerners use this as fantasy therapy. Makes them feel good about their free falling economies
chinese people will bear with it. they could bear ‚Äûthe great leap forward‚Äú. they could bear losing their life saving
Have you heard about USSR?
"As much as I agree that an imminent and utterly complete collapse is unlikely China is in serious trouble. Declining foreign investment started before covid, companies moving out, rapidly increasing youth unemployment, serious energy issues, food toxicity rising at alarming rates, demographic crisis, laying flat or let it burn movements, rapidly decreasing domestic spending, a poor covid vaccine proven to have little effect on newer strains, increasing strain with other nations, decoupling of US and China, rampant corruption and waste, the rich leaving China like a sinking ship, semi- delusional optimism from western investors based on dubious CCP officially reported statistics that are widely known to be way off if not completelyfabricated to save face, companies delisting and refusing audits clearly shows a house of cards. These are all substantial issues validated by leaked CCP reports, videos from on the ground and a mounting concern domestically from those in positions of influence and power says there is something serious going on there. 30 days, a surveillance state can maintain order for a long time( North Korea) but decline over time? Absolutely. But I do very much disagree with the US comparison, these are vastly different economies. The former being the source of the bulk of innovation, services, with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and highly diversified and being the source of the world reserve currency( that contrary to other misinformation is not likely to change as no other currency has the liquidity or confidence of currency to supplant it as clearly demonstrated by the DXY skyrocketing) bodes much better at recovery quickly and maintaining growth than a cheap labor export economy largely based around the appropriating of foreign tech and innovation to make cheap knock offs( simplified, sure but untrue?) Or simply producing others goods for them, they seem to struggle with much real innovation besides the overinflated CCP propaganda claims, yes profitable but only in a highly secure and global market which we are trending away from and have been for sometime. A more suitable analogy would be to a resource based boom environment, gold,oil, whatever you choose but in Chinas case it is cheap labor nothing more. It lacks vital ingredients a country needs to sustain long term growth such as political environment, cultural environment, a level of democratic process and a strong rule of law.China will likely peak then decline as the large aging population retires and other more affordable, honest and dependable nations sort out supply issues and become the next and more sustainable base of world production."
Yeah those videos seemed pretty over the top lol.
"Great video, but I must say, your voice audio is bad."
More like the US economy will collapse...and it's a corporate controlled implosion...WEF planned agenda in their effort to introduce their own currency and a global government...
Agreed... The West and it's allies are finished
"In the early nineties I learned in High school about the population decline of my country and its impact on pensions etc. Though important, the stuff was boring then and came from people that were nerdy and too old.  Thanks to Peter Zeihan and other podcasting sensationalists out there, the ""Dooms Day"" geopolitics, demographics, food security and other global topics are very entertaining and best enjoyed with some pop corn and soft drinks."

"I've been wary of those clickbait videos and whilst this does demonstrate no US or other Asia style collapses, i'm not convinced China won't collapse. This debt crisis isn't their only debt crisis, they've also lost big on high speed rail. Can the Chinese economy actually survive both of these things? Also won't printing more cause big inflation thereby damaging its monetary independence it needs?"
I think one child policy is good thing for china look at india
"Agreed. China is in a unique position that no other country is in. They can print their way out of this crisis, and their people just have to deal with it. What does that look like for the average chinese person? Say a person has a $200k mortgage on an apartment that has not been built yet, but the property developer needs $400k to build the apartment. Well, the chinese government will just print the extra $200k and give it to the property developer. So your $200k apartment is now worth $400k. Chinese property owners are rich... right? not quite. All that printed money now goes into circulation, and everything in their life is now twice as expensive, but they are still making the same money. It will take years for the average chinese person to get back to the quality of life they used to know because wages growth is slower than the governments ability to print money. It is really insidious what they are doing."
"Crazy, China is the world's producer of goods. Just a little sneeze due to Covid, but the goods and spare parts... have been stalled all over the world. If you want China to weaken, pull out your company"
Chinese economy is too big to fail and it will not be in favour of world economy if Chinese economy fail. No matter how much I am against a lot of Chinese Govt's policy I still don't want them to fail.
In my opinion China just following US steps as its laws and regulations are maturing. Recession might happen but recovery will be fast and their work force are still there ready to work.

Capital controls only work over very short periods of time. International investors avoid any economy where capital controls are used; for decades.  Capital controls will eventually destroy any nation's economy.
"I've been hearing that China will collapse for all my life, but China is still growing fast."
Sure not .......but some buildings and dams will
"Collapse.... no.

Suffer some deep issues, yes. Deep seated issues that will likely take some toll on other nations. Maybe not as dramatic, but its certainly bothing to just sit back on. Just nothing to end up in a huge panic over."
I liked some of Business basics videos esp the one TIKTOK and he does tell the truth about the Chinese CCP. But you are so right about all these headlines they use like China will collapse or go bankrupt in 20 to 50 days as if!
"A slow decline is most likely. The exodus of manufacturing, even by the chinese themselves due to no small part of the restrictions of their own government, makes moving out a more attractive and financially sound solution. Chinese companies, if they want to become trully multinationals like those in Europe and American needs to seperate themselves from the clutch of their authorian government. 

What worries me is the CCP more agressive stance towards the world might lead to war, just for the simple fact that ...
1. It allows them to distract their populace by externalising their problem.
2. Rejuvenate their manufacturing industry
3. To restrict and control even more their own people."
What about no production for 2 months because of no power & no rain in sight to restart manufacturing & high unemployment from this? (2) what about the cancellation of orders from large US companies because of overstock?????
I believe the only way to erase and eradicate all evil cesspools in the world is war. WW3 is upon us and we need more brave people right now.
In communist countries corruption does not usually  bring consequences like the democratic Christian nations.

"A Japan-style stagnation would be disastrous, their economy is obviously gigantic in absolute size but the country is still nowhere near as prosperous as Japan, especially outside the big cities and people who work in high income sectors."
Listen to this guy if you wanna lose your money Lmfaao. The misinformation and copium this guy is spouting is ridiculous. Notice how he didn‚Äôt mention any specific numbers or Evergrandes default
"I've watched many of the ""others"" and when they started machine gunning one video after the other about how China is doomed it made me feel like something was off. I'm not a economics expert but it's almost like its some sort of online propaganda war going on against China in an effort to perhaps make investors more likely to run or its just easy youtube money. I'm not pro China, but to think that the western couldn't use some of the same means and methods as China's government does is silly IMHO. Any thoughts out there?"
"just dont agree with the so-called fact that getting a double six is less probable than a double 5 , 4, 3 , 2 or 1...they are the same for any pair of dice, the same way that getting a six is the same as getting a 1 on one dice roll"
"I‚Äôll agree with the soundness of your arguments here, and the analysis would be spot on if you didn‚Äôt ignore a few important factors about the Chinese economy.

Namely the fact that the more centralized the government, the more points of failure will begin to show up. Coupled with increasing and more technology savvy competitors popping up in the manufacturing sector globally, along with a growing trend towards less globalized trade.

These factors essentially means that while china may not fall into depression quickly and visibility. It will be like a slow motion car crash. The combination of corruption increasing as Xi and his cronies begin the slow march toward consolidating all power, and the inevitable contraction of Chinese export income. It‚Äôs only a matter of when the point of no return happens and the slow motion crash steadily gets faster."
"While this video is more objective and emphasizes how wrong it is to use the word ""collapse"", it would still suffer from an accumulation of factors nonetheless. I don't think it'll be enough to prop up Hoovertowns, but the economy is still reeling for the average citizen."

"Most of the videos on this topic that I've watched so far sounded to me as their creators want this to happen. Idk if they have problem with China, but people should be neutral while reporting about stuff that is supposed to be informative. They're also never talking the part why might it not happen. But worst of all is how smug they all seem to be."
I think manufacturing output will drop in China because the supply chain issues that foreign companies have with lockdowns and the potential for a China war. Think they will lose a lot of their manufacturing exports
"You can't simply compare any of these as they are drastically different systems. The issues at hand here are also extremely numerous. For you to reduce it down to just 2 issues and then make pointless comparisons ignores the reality of what China is facing.
China's real estate industry makes up roughly 30% of GDP. Landsales make up 40% of public revenue, funding another 8% of GDP. For comparison, the real estate bubble in China today is 3 times the share of GDP that it was in America in 2008 and slightly greater than the asset bubble in America right before the great depression.
However, that's far from the only issue. China's debt to GDP ratio has increased by the equivalent of 20 percent of contemporary GDP every year since 2008, all while it's GDP growth has continually moderated. Most of those years saw debt growth being 3 times that of GDP growth. Any attempts by China to slow down its debt growth has seen an immediate impact on its economy, causing the government to continuously stall these measures. 
China's rail investment is a half trillion dollar bubble as well, as the vast majority of its rails are running deficits to the point that the total rail system doesn't generate enough revenue to cover its own expenses. The same is true for infrastructure in general. They run massive deficits to invest in infrastructure for the sake of inflating growth figures. Valuable investments were saturated a decade ago, but they can't stop as they don't have anything to replace it.
Consumer spending is dropping as incomes are dropping. 
Public revenue is tanking as all of its sources of revenue are dropping. This has caused local governments to take extreme measures to cut expenses, including requiring employees to pay back bonuses from past years and requiring employees to start paying rent to stay in government housing. 
Etc. I can go on at length pointing out the plethora of issues that China is facing. What I can't go on about is the bright spots in China's economy.
It's not just the housing sector. It's not just the banking sector. It's not just the public sector. It's not just FDI fleeing. It's not just weakening consumer spending. There is no bright spot in the Chinese economy as every single area is in decline. 
Now, sure, the youtubers are over hyping the decline, but it is already happening."

stagnation.
"China's undoing will be more or less a mid to long term event, caused by its rapid demographic collapse which will catch up to its economy in 10~15 years"
Thank you for speaking the truth!@@!
"But China is crashing its whole economy. Stock market is down and continues to slip. Bank runs are happening all over China. Properties value are not truly reflected, it is much lower than local banks estimation hence no bank are lending 70~80% mortgages instead are lending 20~30% mortgages if that.
Public sector and lowering labour salaries second time this year, some as much as 50%., the same goes for private sector.
It is not the end of China, of course not, but things will take a turn for the worse, that's for sure. This is just the beginning of an epic collapse after many years of epic lending, spending and raising of GDP.
Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, use to be all over the headlines in China, now? They are nowhere to be seen. When a country runs on a narrative of patriotism (regularly through lies) stops boasting about how well their ""world leading"" companies are doing, when the liars stops lying and keeps quiet, you know it is serious."
"Okay, so this video is entirely you looking for differences versus other economies that have suffered an extreme recessions and saying ‚Äúfor that reason, I‚Äôm out‚Äù and then piling on the theme that ‚Äúthe Chinese government will learn from past mistakes‚Äù‚Ä¶ all these recessions will be occur in different ways, and you as an economist should recognize that you can‚Äôt account for every that plays into a real life scenario *why economists get things wrong*"

"Even if it isnt true, i still hope for the collapse of the ccp traitorous scum. Reclamation of the homeland must be achieved."
Nice video. Its always healthy to get varying perspectives on any given topic. I know there has been a lot of sensationalised Youtubers preaching the imminent fall off the Chinese economy. Short term I agree its unlikely but mid to long term I'm not so sure. Peter Zeihan has made some strong arguments as to why he feels the current Chinese economic model is failing and his primary reasoning is due to an accelerating deglobalisation of the global economy and a rapidly worsening demography. What are you thoughts or responses to Peter Zeihan's views?
right now china is a manufactured economy. the economy is whatever the ccp says it is. its not complicated.
YOU MIGHT BE WRONG ON THIS ONE
"Your argument don't make sense at all. You only described China structurally is different from the West and those failed countries, but you provided now rationale and linkage why it is unlikely to collapse. After all, any organized system has its own way to disintegrate, it's just people never see it can't recognize it, especially those who have little to no understanding of the Chinese history. Also check the 3rd law of thermodynamics."
"Will it collapse, probably not? Well, it has a depression, probably, it will probably have a housing crisis similar to the states but a bit worse due to the fact that the houses that are in crisis don't even exist, and covid lockdowns are adding a bigger hit. Will it have infighting party conflict for power, probably and it might go extreme? Xi Ji Ping's third term decision is coming up soon and he trying his best to raise figures, whether it be by lies or by dumping money and worrying later. we might see some soviet era purge or a more extreme version of Xi Ji Ping ""Anti-Corruption Campagin"" who knows what will happen if we will resist a lot to remain in power, or if we will either way or if he will be replaced?"
"China will just wash the debt and pretend it never happened, they are never letting this crash anything, they will stagnate yes but they are not going to ""crash"" it's going to probably hit industrial expansion and be retarded so they can save face but it's the Chinese we are talking about so that's a given"
"Talk about comparing apples to oranges.
The arguments get summed up to:
Ted can't be dying he was shot in the heart, while Mike, who died from having his throat slit.  They are not the same so Ted can't die because this throat wasn't slit."
"In just 10 minutes this immediately made more sense to me than all of the sensationalist videos on the topic. Well done, and thank you.

I do agree that it's more likely that an imminent collapse is not coming. However, I think China's biggest problem is the prioritization of interests within its government. Under Xi Jinping's government control has always been the highest priority, even over economic growth and stability. Hence why we see things such as crackdowns on China's massive tech industry and a complete lack of concessions to keep foreign investment in China. I suspect there may be a push from Xi to start walking back some of the privatizations in the Chinese economy and return to a more centralized economic model, but at this point I'm trying to read the mind of someone whose life is so different from mine I wouldn't even begin to comprehend his rationale.

Besides, privatization in China was only meant to be a ""step"" on the road to the Chinese idea of socialism. All the CCP would have to do is call the step a success and renationalize the industry. Privatization in China has an ideological expiration date, and economic stagnation or decline may trigger the end of private ownership in the PRC as it uses up the last of its usefulness.

I suppose we'll have to just wait and see how things slowly go down in China. But whichever way it goes, it seems likely to me the CCP will likely continue to make decisions that require no concessions or reduction of powers from their government, which does limit the pool of choices they have to work with."
This is what I call the MSG effect its when people believe anything because of their hate of China.
"The same economics channels who were predicting Russia economic collapse are predicting China economic collapse, we all know how this turned out. At this point the western shills are pretty easy to identify."

"Everything depends on what you mean by 'collapse'. Will the PRC collapse like the Soviet Union? Probably not (yet). Will the PRC go bankrupt like Sri Lanka? Probably not (yet). Will the economy continue to grow? Certainly not as much as before, and this is what most commentations refer to as 'the collapse'. Structural flaws, ageing population, bad or no decisions, and sabre rattling. But first of all the saturation. The PRC no longer escapes the economic cycles, as 'ever-growing', and has become 'mature'. But given the unprecedented scale of this economy, we are actually pretty entitled to talk about 'disaster' when you realise that this downturn will throw literally millions on the.... hehe, I almost have slipped that it - on the dole, - but In China, you don't get social benefits, which naturally only deepens the crisis. So in short, yes, I would use the word 'collapse' still."
"It will collapse, water scarce, food shortages, energy blackouts, property boom is over, the west diversified it's production of materials to other countries beside only China, like Vietnam, India, Kenya, Morocco, Thailand  etc... China has now to compete against those upcoming economies while having its own internal issues and being sanctioned..."
"China's problem is a split in the party and civil war, while fighting Taiwan and allies."
"While I myself actually enjoy watching the sensational, clikbait-y videos, I do agree with you more that there won't be an overnight collapse. However, one thing I think we can all agree on is that China's economy is going downhill and will keep going downhill for the foreseeable future. Government corruption, mismanagement, a shrinking and increasingly apathetic population, and general loss of faith from their greater world economy at large, means there's likely no good news coming for China anytime soon."
"Of course, China's economy won't most likely crash. If you believe clickbaity video previews,  that's on you.

I watch ""Business Basics""  and besides the ""horror"" type scenarios he makes his video previews in, to get more views, he is able the provide some interesting information."
Explain why local governments had to hire local thugs to beat up mortgage holders protesting about mortgage repayments on properties that may never be completed. As well as hiring actors to pretend to be construction workers as well as governments allowing rural banks to go bankrupt earlier in the week.
There is no way any country's economy will collapse if they can just make more money to keep themselves standing.
if China is really collapse then China will turn to a bigger North Korea or a second Soviet Union lmao

The Only channel I trust for economic opinions . No agenda no BS ... pure economics .
"Japan's economic stagnation is because the United States prohibited Japan from developing the semiconductor industry 40 years ago through the Hiroshima agreement, which directly caused the rise of semiconductor in Taiwan and South Korea. However, the United States cannot do the same thing with China, because China is militarily independent and can compete with the US in the very short future if it has not already done so. Therefore, China will not cooperate with the US like Japan cooperate to cut down its own semiconductor industry. The difference between China and Japan is also that there is only one economic pillar in Japan, the automobile industry, and the traditional cars in Japan will soon be replaced by Chinese electric cars and new energy vehicles. China has all of the industrial classifications in the world and all kinds of economic pillars.  The losses caused by failed industries will soon be compensated by other successful industries. China is not like Japan 40 years ago, nor like the US in 2008, but more like the United States before World War II. The only thing that can really threaten China's development is the COVID policy, that is binds itself. I think this situation will last until the end of this year, China will have to fully open up next year."
"I've been looking for a different, unbiased perspective on this situation but if I remember anything from freshman ECON1301, the government printing money for banks to prevent a bank run will only exacerbate inflation. Can someone ELI5 how this will prevent an economic collapse?"

"I never thought for a second that the Chinese economy would simply collapse. Nevertheless these bankruns, combined with ruthless COVID measures are undermining the trust of regular people on the state's ability to provide for the Chinese public"
Whatever!!! Nobody knows what happens!! You can guess as much as you want!!
‚ÄúExperts‚Äù have been predicting that China is on the verge of collapse since 2009 lol
"It's not going to happen in 20 something days...   but China is finished.
Sorry, but they are going to starve."
I've lived here for 7 years and I agree with this prediction. One thing about China is that they will actually punish the people responsible for the corruption which lead to massively overleveraged real estate developers and people will actually face prison time (or execution). So even though they get bailed out; it doesn't necessarily incentivez behaviour like that in the future. The US are too wimpy to actually put somebody with high net worth in a real prison.
The Chinese economy might collapse but not the government. It's an authoritarian regime
I think you projected more accurate situation than most main stream media.....
"I agree. 

China's economy will not ""crumble"" in ""27 days,"" etc., or anything near that. 

With that said, I think it is reasonable to project that China has seen the zenith of its growth, and the monopoly of the global marketplace pass. 

Japan, in the 1970s, was (like China) the 2nd largest economy in the world, and (like China) was expected to surpass the US as the economic leader of the world, and (like China) was considered the ""manufacturing hub of the world."" 

But, as we are seeing in China today, economic, political, demographic and outside pressures caused that to come to a grinding halt as the global picture reshuffled itself. 

That, I believe, is what is happening today. 

Foreign investment and Western corporations are fleeing China for ""safer"" Asian markets (Vietnam, Thailand, India, etc.) as China digs deeper into a militaristic, Moa-like Communistic rule, and moves away from the Deng era ""free global marketplace"" system that made China rich in the first place. 

This will, of course, take years, possibly a decade to see the dust settle, but when that happens, we will see a new economic (and possibly militaristic) global picture emerge.

Economics does not work in days.

It is a long game, and always has been."
FINALLY I have been sick of the people who always make out china to be on the brink of collapse. I understand it looks bad but pretending there will be some overnight meltdown is ignores the realities at play in the second largest economy in  the world.
Its failing brother the bust is here for them.
"While collapse seems unlikely, we may be seeing a seismic shift in China's growth story"
"But bcoz of china, US economy will crash for sure as china holds a major portion of forex reserves as china starts selling those reserve to save its bank and economy which they have already the price of dollar will go down."
Nah those are just click bait titles. China‚Äôs economy won‚Äôt collapse anytime soon but it sure does look like shit.
"The US should crack down on its tech, military complex and capitalist educations. Wealth only concentrate at the top 1%"
"well, i got to account for the social issue that all the chinese is facing too. A lot of the younger generation is starting to just give up as they can't find any job and are getting depress. Choosing to just lie flat"
"All the China is collapsing nonsense just shows Youtube is becoming a misleading source of information, everyone is just click baiting with thumbnails, it doesn't matter if it's true or what, only the views matter."
"Finally, someone with gray matter in their brain said it out loud. The noise of smooth-brainers keeps flooding my news feed. However, expect being called china bot and other slurs after this."
"Those youtubers will sell their mothers for views. They're like those doomsday cults with a definite date for the end of days. What are they going to do when that day has been and gone? Haha, charlatans."
"As a Commercial Banker for international Corps in China, i thumbs up this video.
the click bait style Chinese collapse shit on youtube is just badly researched.
I too personally believe the Japanese style ""collapse"" to be the most likely scenario for China, mainly because policy similarities that both governments took when looking at 1960-1990s vs 2000-2022 which both involved heavy infrastructure investment and key stimulants in specific industries. 
I mean the collapse of real estate might be even good for regional development as observed in Japan after 1990s when skilled labor rushed out of Tokyo(the larger cities) to a cheaper living places and the original investments in infrastructure across the country actually fueled this type of migration by making relocations easier"
Wumao
I dont think he appreciates that people are fleeing China as part of their supply chain
"No collapse, just plenty of internal issues to solve--which they will do --at the Chinese peoples cost!"
"I think a major hurdle for a lot of advanced Asian economies like Korea, China, and Japan is something you touched on in your video. It's that young people are not having kids anymore. The high pressures they face from school, to work just doesn't lend to creating families. Jack Ma famously said Alibaba succeeded because of the 996, working from 9 am to 9 pm 6 days a week. Work culture is so toxic there. Korea has a birth rate of 0.8, and China and Japan are close behind as well. These countries also are not traditional immigration destinations. This is already affecting them now and will be only more severe in the future. A couple taking care of 4 parents, working 60+ hour weeks, are not likely pumping out babies. 1/5 of young people (20-25) are also unemployed right now. I don't think we're seeing a Sri Lanka in the short term, but there are significant, unique challenges ahead for these economies that will not be solved with monetary policy alone."
you get my sub
The probability of hitting double 6 is the same as hitting double 3..
Well YouTube is a part of the See Eye Aye. ü§î
"If China's central government takes charge, they should be able to get through this. But so far, the central government has just tried to tell the local governments to deal with the problem. Mostly just talk from the men at the top, not backed by much actual money. Everyone is still playing CYA, no one is taking responsibility. We'll see if they are able to get their act together, but the history of institutional idiocy with the Great Leap Forward and the One Child Policy certainly give reason for worry."
"Surprisingly, there are viewers for any stupid things on youtube üòÇ"
Is there a laugh smileyü§£
I whole heartedly agree.  I have been saying something similar for MONTHS - if not longer.  The 'world' does not agree with us - but at least we agree!
"This is a shameful misrepresentation of the waste, fraud and corruption occurring in the housing market that most certainly WILL push them to collapse if not to invade Taiwan or worse."

"Finally, found a YouTuber is talking sense now."
"the so called ""China will fall in 30 days"" has been there since 1980s...
this sure is a very long 30 days...."
Joeri 2024! (President? Fed Chief?)
"06:24 no...it is NOT ""basically funded by foreign countries"", it's funded by the full faith and credit of the United States inhabitants meaning the energy of the people. We were used as collateral for the bail out if you understand what actually happened with HJR 192 and Executive Order 6102.

China still relies on our over consumption meaning they will collapse and they can't be saved by printing their way out since America is the world's reserve backed on nothing."
yea...unfortunately for the rest of the world... China's economy is not really going to collapse.
What about these 20 other videos that get posted everyday saying it will?

"Your social credit score just went up, comrade!"
"Finally a more balanced take on this issue! All the other channels seemed so swept in this intense narrative so it is really nice to see something that actually seems to display the issue as it is, rather than obvious being pro or anti China propaganda. I have subscribed and hope to see more balanced perspectives like this in the future!"
"Gordon Chang was probably the early one predicting China's collapse by 2011, then 2012. He could have predicted forever.   Followed by a bunch of suckers' predictions.  They are based on wishful thinking and not reality.  Two more points were raised before on Chinese economy.  The high saving rate of ordinary people and the system where migrant workers actually always have a backup of their livelihood, most have plot of land to farm on as a last resort, something the CCP set up to ensure stability. So no chao and pandemonium are really foreseen for now."
"I don‚Äôt think a total collapse is going to happen, but now the heat wave and energy crisis are just piling on to the housing problems."
Keynesian economics?
The only thing China may have learned is that certain ways to deal with crises do not work. What it has clearly not learned is the need to follow policies that prevent crises.
so JP Morgan already admited China is in a big finance problem...ohh.btw who the fcuk are you?? any economic background?
"One thing to mention is the highly indebted local governments. The Chinese economy will go into a severe recession. The Japanese economic recession of the 90s have drastically affected the country for nearly 15 years. Internal political conflicts within the CCP and China ever-growing isolation from the rest of the world are facts that will greatly affect its social stability. 
Plus, I don't trust any data publish by the Chinese government, as we all know they redact their data before releasing them.  The golden age of insane economic growth is sadly over for China.
It seems your video has attracted a couple of wumao. I guess you caught the eye of the CCP."

So listen to Money & Macro with real actual data will give you real insight."
"A democratic China will be one of the greatest nation ever on our planets history, the only problem china has is a lack of freedom and a big shadow corruption. I wish the best for the people of china."
I'm not against what you're saying. Won't producing more money devalue their currency and push then futher into a recession?
Finally
Thank you for a fresh perspective on this topic!
How much is the CCP paying you to make this video ?

Specially Indian YouTubers lol
"The population of China is collapsing so will the economy, but it will take about 10-20 years. They will not be able to provide a meaningful workforce that supported their recent economic success- that‚Äôs in the process of ending. This is happening at a faster rate due to the disastrous One Child Policy. China isn‚Äôt like the US, emigration to China is fairly insubstantial. If the US or some Eurozone countries are having a population decline they can simply turn the nozzle and allow more people in and there‚Äôs plenty of people who would like to live in those places‚Ä¶ who would want to live in China? Not many non-Chinese"
U.S economy will collapse and meltdown soon. From Vietnamese to sexy white men will backstab the U.S country and the future U.S administration.
Thank you for being a refreshing voice of reason in a sea of click baiters
Just click bait. That's how you bring in subscribers and views.
There can be 3 responses to this; people will not believe any part of this; people will believe all of this; People will simply wait and see.
china is in huge trouble eventually it will collapse but not now people are predicting it's gonna collapse now but we don't know when it'll collapse there's only 2 problems for china oil and food there screwed here like 80 percent of that is imported if the world has a shortage chinas gonna loose some people
"China economy collapse is highly unlikely, slow down is rather close to certainty"
"no where close. china is not even in a recession. they simply lowered their growth from target 7% to lower. stagnation is not happening either. china will recover from this and slowly grow over time, similar to what the US is doing. the years of 10-15% yoy growth is over for china"
"Please don‚Äôt confuse people by saying  ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù for Bitcoin, no one is using crypto to evade China.  Just Bitcoin."
You won a subscriber very well tough content.Thank you
Ahh. Well paid pro commie youtuber that i been searching for. üòé
"this is all an illusion created by these youtuber/influencers paid by NGOs to spread American propaganda, when in fact what happens is the opposite, USA is falling, polarization growing, angry and anxious citizens, and a lot of dumb people with a terrible education system, who can't avoid a 16/18 year old mass shooting an school."
"thank you, it's exhausting to keep seeing all the click-baity videos"
don't you think it will bring inflation?
"Yeah - printing money is to government, what laying off staff is to a company.  It kind of fools your shareholder or voters into thinking things are being managed well, profits are still ""looking strong"" and the stock market indicated things are hunky-dory - but it hurts your future as you have to ""pay the piper"" down the road. To me it is kind of like having cashflow issues so you start to ""garage sale"" off things you can live without (at least for now) at a fraction of their true worth - to have cash in the pocket to wrap your hands around to make your feel wealthy again."
Clearly stated rebuttal to all the doom and bloomers.  I think China will save its own economy to the detriment of outside capital.  Be prepared for China to protect its markets and nationalize outside ownership if war or sanctions were to occur.  I can not imagine any other scenario where china becomes isolated in trade.   The Covid Crisis has already isolated china in travel.
This analysis is mostly good. but your missing the most crucial aspect of the crisis. China has no way to get money to the government. the housing collapse is undermining the very mechanism (70 year leases on housing) that funds the chinesse government right at the time that all those leases are expiring. Revenue collapse is the real danger for china. not the banking system collapse. this is a MUCH worse scenario than the great Depression. think Spain losing its entire empire. IF china can replace its revenue stream it can survive. if not we havn't seen a crisis like this since the 1600s which lasted 200 years and was never solved.
Can you argue that a Japan-like stagnation scenario that has been going on for 20+ years is worse than the US great recession scenario where the US recovered in 5 years?
CCP agent paid by XI
"So what you're saying is the central government just needs to print money, wham bam the issue is solved?? I doubt your theory greatly. China's problems are profound and all caused by mismanagement 
1. Property bubble
This has been caused by a market of who's the biggest idiot. People so eager to get into property they buy anything. There are 19 ghost cities in china. Enough that if they were finished and made habitable would house the population of France 3 times over.

The belt and road initiative 
This was about buying sovereignty from other countries. One of the major reasons Sir Lanka and Pakistan are in deep financial problems. China would see the return of that money.

1 child policy 
Should have ended in the 1990s but was continues. China demographic is way worse than Japan in the 90s and with no immigration,  china has a massive issue which can't be fixed for 20 to 30 year provided women have more than 1 baby. Most Chinese women I've spoke to aren't interested in more kids, they have enough financial obligations with just 1.

China's fast train network
Once a great success they decided to expand it nation wide. Most line run at massive looses and can only be used for passengers.  Freight lines have been neglected due to the expense of fast rail.

Costs of running detention camps
Well known in xinjiang they are also in Tibet as well. Costs of manning, policing, food supplies. The list is long. Sure they make some of it back via slave labour. 

Infrastructure projects that are ridiculous 
South North water transfer project. Will cost 3 trillion usd to take water from the south to Beijing's.  There are cheaper and better options

To run the militia (pla is not a military by definition)
These are cheap to run, ask the usa about that. Part of their role is to prevent civil unrest rather than protecting boarders and other normal military duties.

These are but a few issues. No economy, certainly not a centralised one can manage all of these and more. Your video hasn't dealt in details on how the ccp will manage and over come all of these.

Politically china has worked on, we let you make money in turn for political obedience.  What happens when citizens loose money? The ccp looses face?? Loosing face is way worse than recession.  Hence the Taiwan issue. A polarising issue to distract its citizens from the fact the ccp broke its promise to its people of 10% gdp growth continuously.  Where japan faded china will go for glory. What will be the cost to humanity?"
"Personally,  I believe the USA economy will collapse very far before the Chinese economy."
"As a Taiwanese, seeing those kind of videos really is frustrating. There's no way China collapse like other countries: there is no way CCP can't or won't intervene.
If China ""collapse"", officials will be literally eat clean by the people. Guns and bullets won't stop desperation and despair."
"China ALSO has a $1T shortfall in its high speed rail network burdens... It's in for TONS of pain and unrest- even to the point of bringing in thugs to harass protestors. 
Will it ""crash""? Not likely in the 1929 sense, no... BUT to say it will all be just fine in the end is likely too optimistic, too."
Actually the decreasing birth rate is not caused by one child policy. It is the high living cost and low salary. Chinese new generation just realize it will take their almost whole life salary to buy a house and their kids get good education. So They decide not to get married and stay alone forever.
Don't forget the Home Alone face on your Youtube video thumbnail for clicks! :)
YouTube is full of false news. It's refreshing to get the real honest views from channel like you.
Thank you for not following other youtubers and for not using a stupid face image.
I really got bored from that china is going to collapse videos. Thanks
"Thank you Joeri, I am new to your channel and now looking forward to following you via notifications. I believe the underlying reason why China's socio-economic circumstances will not deteriorate to the same extent of other major powers; is China's more disciplined (referred to by most Western media as authoritarian) and efficient form of governance. What the world is witnessing in the PRC is the rise of the largest ever socialist super power; thanks in no small measure to having strictly applied Marxist theory and ideas to all 14 of its 5 year plans (ie; 70 years). Neoliberalism is a fundamentally flawed concept that is now failing, something has to replace it and that something is the early stages of modern socialism with particular sovereign national characteristics."
"China won't collapse, but stagnation like Japans lost decade will severely damage China's image of being an economic superpower and cause them to fall behind the US economy again"
"Thank you for this video. While I do have my disagreements and opinions on the way that China is ran, its economy just isn't going to collapse and honestly, its annoying to see so much sensationalist content saying shit like ""CHINA ECONOMY WILL COLLAPSE IN 30 DAYS!!??"". I do think that recession is coming for China within the next decade and when they do emerge out of recession many structural reforms will be made and the economy will stagnate as long-term issues like its bleak demographic future, rising dependency ratios, decreasing foreign investment and the toll of wealth inequality kicks in. However, China will emerge out of this intact. Everything they're doing now is being done to prevent an economic depression or collapse and while the Chinese government has made mistakes, it tends to be more pragmatic."
"While everyone is struggling with inflation, China is facing a lot of deflationary pressure. In China most of the critical industries are nationalized. Global demand for goods is waning and China's real estate is falling a lot of the demand for things like steel has fallen significantly. Since steel production is a nationalized industry in China the government is unwilling to downsize it's production in order to keep more of it's citizens employed. On top of that all the nations are looking to buy up the US dollar to protect their currency, China being an export economy doesn't want their own currency to increase in value. China is going to have to get rid of a lot of the US dollar holdings if they don't want their currency to deflate too much."
Thank you! This is ACTUALLY informative not like the other YouTube videos out there
@money & macro are we sure china‚Äôs property bubble is actually larger than the roman empires?
"They are losing power because of the electricity crisis, stopped for the Olympics& lockdowns. No manufacturing power. They have access to minerals but they‚Äôre losing access to chips. They haven‚Äôt learned a lesson, look at how they reacted with Australia. Losing their coals access and can‚Äôt replace it without doing changes to their facilities. India kicked them out of their phone market, & Apple will start mnf in India."
im betting it does

"This is nothing new. Yawn.ü•±

Every year, ritualistically, The Economist, Gordon Chang and a cohort of fools will predict without fail China is collapsing like Chicken littles on the sky falling. This has been happening for the last 4 decades.

Every year it never happens, China's industry powers on.

The better question is why these fools have a ton of fools who prefer to keep listening to them . Who is the bigger fool? the fool talking crap or the fools listening to fools?

These people will keep looking for bias confirmation.

Not too long ago, China was going to collapse because of covid. Instead it controlled the virus and exported even more goods.

Then you had people claiming China's 3 gorges dam was going to collapse.

These people who prefer to believe lies should ask themselves, if you are lied to about one thing over and over again, what else are these so called West experts lying to you about?

At some point you have to wonder why you are so stupid? 


ü§£"
"Yeah, this is definitely a much more nuanced and reasoned take. Doesn't deny the possibility of a collapse from China, but seems much more realistic about how China could maneuver to deal with their issues. Will admit that I was starting to buy into the sensationalist videos a bit, but then I started noticing the signs of algorithm abuse. (Thought this was another clickbait video at first, too, tbh. Decided to check it out purely because it was proclaiming against the trend and I was curious)."
"Yeah you could feel the nonsensical nature of all these videos even if you couldn't verbalize why they seem so phony.  That being said, I think we all wish china would collapse in some way....the future does not look like a very good place to live in for generatinos to come if Chinas world view takes over as the sole superpower.  Considering they're an entirely monolithich xenophonibic society that is completely controlled by their government.  What a terrible terrible bleak outlook for our world.  The only good news I see is that their population is going to be reduced somewhat so the impact possibly won't be as great."
You are partially wrong. CCP n liberal world order will collapse by the end of 2028. US Capitol changed accounting rules n triggered 2006-2007 finance crisis
China is the Bible chosen upcoming nation that will march to Armageddon with 200 millions troops and fight against Israel...just watch it's unveiling soon...
8:10 Russia also required all other countries to use the Ruble to buy products from them which caused the ruble to hit new 5 year highs.
Is China a net exporter with a trade surplus?  China imports everything to manufacture before exporting.  By trade surplus is that because they pay a $1 for raw material and then export it for $5 ?
"The videos referenced at the beginning are hyperbolic for sure, but it makes no sense to relate China to US depressions either.  China is headed into uncharted territory for sure though.  They will cover everything up for as long as possible, which itself has negative consequences, but the cover ups also prevent negative contagion from spreading.  Tell people we are in recession constantly and they will tighten up, exacerbating the present.  But pretending things are rosy when they are not causes a lot of people to lose their life savings.  Pick your poison."
"It does not mater much to me if colapses or not.   Thats because the entire enterprise is demographically evaporating anyway.   It will soon enough just dry up and blow away.  Perhaps in slow motion, berhaps not."
"Dude, throwing double 3, 4 or 5's  is not in the slightest more likely than a double 6"
"Corruption and incompetence make a collapse more likely, but I agree that stagnation is the most likely outcome."
African gold and diamonds will get them out of jail
The bought and paid for media is stupid...China supplies the world with everything and has Gola to back it up.
"Good video and appreciate the input. Small criticism: When you say ""humble"" opinion, you've already revealed your arrogance. There's no such thing as a ""humble"" opinion when it's iterated."
1. Like China would let west know they are collapsing yeah... üòÇ
"China will create hyper inflation problem. China has a shrinking capital investment, as manufacturing facilities are closed and opened in other nations. If that was not bad enough, a rapid population decline that will leave China with nearly 50% people in the year 2050. It may not be a collpase but it is certainly never going to be a super power that can over take the world. At best it will fall into a regional power and must rebuild an entire new system."
You're going to feel really silly when it collapses.
This video title is clearly clickbait. These comments sound like propoganda bots.
"Omg, I am so relieved to finally find a video with sense. All those YouTube channels waving the ""China will collapse"" flag are either propagandas or idiots who don't read enough. They nitpick what fits their narrative and omit the rest. Not saying that China's economy is not in trouble, but it's just not as bad. Esp. when you put it side by side next to some other developed economies atm."
Most things said about China are false. The US media is constantly lying about China. You need to speak Chinese or get reports from English speaking Chinese living in China. The mainstream monopoly media just vilified everything about China.
Finally soeone who doesn't think a country's economy with 1.4 billion pepole is going to just collapse like a house of cards and all other countries just keep watching like that.
"My opinion is that, this might not be completely on the nose, this is taking on a macro economic perspective to the issue, while ignoring the degree to which the populis has exposure the the housing market, and the political ramifications of not being able to stop coverage of independent bank runs, as well as the protests. Is the situation over hyped, yes, but are there going to be serious fallouts to this situation, also yes"
Its amazing how easy it is when billionaires arent the priority
Isnt the reason for all these videos about the upcoming payment they have with one of their devolopers that will cause the fall of all the sectors ?
The purchasing power of the Chinese people has already dropped below India though.
Quite phatetic when in real life is already going to pieces. At least for the normal people. Chinese people don't go demonstrate for nothing.
"In a few words, no histeria, but its not looking good for China. Got it."
Been collapsing since the 1980's
"China‚Äôs economic recovery will highly depends on who the next leader will be. Xi is more interested in the centralized control finance style but Li insists to continue with their current free market style.
China‚Äôs total clash won‚Äôt happen over night, as they don‚Äôt have personal bankruptcies therefore the banks can pass the bad debts to the individuals to share the impact of real estate market collapse.
Nevertheless China‚Äôs economy is certainly going downhill and you don‚Äôt want to invest there."
"I do think that China will take a hit, and its growth will be slowed. But youtubers making videos about it are overstating what will actually happen."
It's CCP propaganda trying to throw us all off guard while they invade Taiwan
no because its propgating the continuation and sustainment of a bullsh*t non existant or what should've been non existant part of reality not able to be apart of reality system based on loophole jumping corruption and manipulation for the sustainment of itself and its corruptness to make ppl reliant on it in blind incompetance and subserviancy to where everyone is relianbt on the destructive evil bulsh*t and it is been culturally manipulated into ppl conditioned minds as such a normal part of life that it becomes this world
Just subbed! Thanks for not hopping on the uneducated echo chamber side of yt. I try and look at the big picture and secondary consequences etc too.
It will collapse eventually - centrally controlled economies virtually always do - at som point their own corruption will destroy them
"Yeah people can be ‚Äúrelieved‚Äù this guy is saying the opposite of others. But didn‚Äôt really touch on how the Chinese economy is gonna deal with a 44%-60% decrease in population by 2100. Or how the potential effects of deglobalisation might play out, as we are seeing global companies begin to diversify their manufacturing and also some pulling out of China. I personally don‚Äôt see a future where China in its current political climate can work again with western nations like it enjoyed in the past. Coming from an Australian I would be pretty disgusted at any continuation of China centric policies no matter how much we might benefit from them. Their aggressive diplomacy has won them no favours in many parts of the globe and I personally don‚Äôt see them being able to just change from this stance leading to further polarisation and calls for economic independence free from Chinese manufacturing."
Propaganda exist on both sides either you endorse CCP or be anti CCP and it is obvious that it is a click-baity sensationalist attempt to say china will collapse in any X days because come on. This is what happens when you become anti CCP thinking you are on the moral side (as I used to do) while the reality is complicated
It's in West and Indian media that Chinese economy collapses. Childish feeling out of sheer jealousy and hatred.
"If China's economy is going to collapse, the western world's inflation will be a catastrophic apocalypse. All those fake you tubers should be shot."
"Last time I checked, chicken little spoke English. Lotta people speaking of China failing are speaking English so bullshit must be part of the English language. Not to say China does have problems, but they bought A LOT of gold..."
Are you just copying ADVChina now?
Chinese was a closed economy for almost eternally until 1997. It doesn't need anyone for just survival
"Thank you so much for this video, I knew the sensationalist crap was garbage but didn‚Äôt know where to look for a more nuanced opinion. Fastest I have ever subscribed to a channel."
"Great work. Makes me wonder how the other YT didn't have arrive at the same conclusion. I get they hungry for views but why destroy their rep to get it. I think you could have elaborated more on how China's economy is diversified and balanced enough that if one sector fails, there is sufficient strength in the others to help bolster the entire economy until the failing sector recovers or at least gets to a stable position even if it leads to eventual decline in that particular sector."
"I'd argue a centrally planned economy and authoritarian government makes the Chinese vastly more at risk of massive catastrophic, irrecoverable collapse. It may not be currently underway but I do believe it is virtually inevitable.

...And the world doesn't need China's manufacturing long term, there's plenty of other developing/third-world countries to pivot to along with increased automation allowing labor intensive industries to return home, it's already begun."
"The sensationalists know a lot of people want to see China fail. I hate the CCP, but it doesn't mean I want China to fail. They'd take the rest of the world with them if that ever happened."
The sensationalists predicting so many days till collapse are running out of time.  They‚Äôre like palm readers and psychics.
Who is this clown.
"You're very graceful, and present things nicely. I will have to watch again. Very informative üëç"
Finally somebody other that real China experts calling this bs out!
Youtube lets people say what they want. Many things are untrue but stupid people still believe them.
"I'm glad to see a video of the opposite opinion than the ones you mentioned. Very refreshing... and I understand you are using the info you have to make your points. I disagree however, with them not experiencing more pain and a recession . There are alot more factors involved than you included in the video. Inflation isnt just an American phenomenon.. and more spending and more printing categorically 100% will exacerbate these. Then theres governmental and party corruption, which every nation faces.  USA. CHINA, RUSSIA. .. looming famine, or higher prices of foods.  Widespread drought. Civil unrest. Looming war..the evergrande and country garden sagas are huge...but only pieces of the puzzle.  Good video none the less. We need more differing opinions and discussions in this world. We have division with no conversation."
"They have been predicting China‚Äôs collapse since it first opened up, and they have been wrong ever since"
"It's not going to collapse, but rather a trade off curve between China's replacement plan and political leverage"
"I hate propaganda, jfc"
"So basically you are saying china can magic away its economic problems. Yeah china can always tianemen square away stuff but, average chinese citizens are going to have to pay the price at the end of the day."
"Nice video but you are missing a point tho, I do concern more about the fact that many chinese people not trusting their banks and governments anymore. Which many videos have shown (tanks in the street and helpin banks) and this will make the economic blow heavier for china. Because trust is maybe the most important factor in money and economics."
CCP paid you for this huh?
+999999999 social credit
"Nah china will fall, but not in the way you think, it will be just sad, slowly decay with a shit ton of propaganda telling everyone that china is producing 900% of his real production. And everything is awesome, and slowly getting quieter and quieter until no body give a fuck, the birhrates are dogshit, the trust in the real state is over, banks are next, china will never have a revolution or a proper change, just decay, is just gonna be a shit show for the next 50 years."
"Gordon Chang has been saying this for years‚Ä¶they‚Äôre about to collapse, blah.  And like a Ukrainian counterattack, it never happens, in spite of YouTube predictions."
"China faces some serious headwinds which could seriously affect its wider economy. The recent flooding has seriously affrected many older dams. 
The heat waves  have damaged crops just the the time they are maturing. This could affect food security later in the year.
The real estate crisis has hurt millions of small investors who are very likely to a change in leadership in the next election.
International relations are hurting trade not with just the US but with many of its neighbouring countries that China has bullied in the Pacific with its navy.
The big crisis with the Chinese economy this summer is a lack of power generation for its citizens and it industries. China needs to expand its power generation capacity significantly to keep it's economy from shrinking.
It would be interesting to see how you view these headwinds and to see if you think their impact on the Chinese economy is significant."
"One more thing, China has such a massive population base with an incredible economical gap between countrysides and cities which can in theory help to soften financial impacts. China has still 80% of the population live beneath the poverty line."
"but why are all ""these Youtubers"" coming out with the same ""prediction"" for China?"
As a rule if you keep predicting every day for 60 years 'a disaster is gonna happen' and it finally happens that's not you being prescient. That's just you getting hit with a statistical probability.
Finally a counter video for that fear mongering click baity video! Thank you!
So basically it‚Äôll still stagnate.
Us dollars collapsed
"While I do think that a lot of the doomsayers on YouTube are over-dramatizing the economic situation in China, I also think that you are missing some of the biggest factors increasing the risks to China's economy. 

To my mind, the absolute biggest risk for China's economy is the knock on effect for local government funding from the population collapse. As you said in your video, China is not the United States. In China, the vast majority of taxes are imposed and collected by the national government, while the vast majority of social services, such as healthcare, pensions, unemployment, and (local) public transportation, are paid for by local governments. However, as anyone who has looked at the government budget allotments could tell you, social services are some of the most expensive programs for a government to run. This has allowed the national government to run a surplus, but has caused major problems for local governments.

To solve these funding problems, local governments have for decades been leasing their land to property developers. This was all fine and good when the real estate market bubble expanded, but now that the pop has occurred, this strategy has begun to fail. I worry that the worsening economic conditions in China's real estate market and their corresponding effects in banking, manufacturing, and raw materials will cause a negative feedback loop that reduces the availability of local government funding while simultaneously increasing utilization of public services that local governments are obligated to provide. This, in turn, could force the national government to simultaneously provide massive stimulus while also bailing out local government, which would have disastrous effects on the yuan and the Chinese economy as a whole."
Thank you! I‚Äôve been watching that stuff and my instinct told me they were fishing clicks. None of those guys are economists.
"Who would have told that, if you see a bump in the road, you can keep the speed and prepare to maneuver when you don't instinctively either push the gas or the brake when you do?"
"i was going insane, when they kep updating the number of days... not the best hahah"
"lmao graham stephen on there, blind leading the blind"
"The only click baity thing about those other channels is the timing.  They will come down. And so will we. 
They have a huge demographics issue that cannot be overcome with central planning.  Infact the absolute control China had will only make it worse."
We‚Äôll see who‚Äôs right in a month or two.
"That‚Äôs what I have been saying for days that if China‚Äôs economy collapsed, America‚Äôs would do too"
"It is entirely depend on how you define ""collapse"". It is as easy to argue that China's economy has already collapsed as to argue China's economy will never collapse. Chinese government can easily prevent a financial crisis by printing a lot of RMB, which of course will have consequences. The whole world will feel the consequences in the coming years, perhaps decades."
"the people who control the us banks will save china, it's probably their greatest opportunity to enslave them with debt."
China can just kick the can down the road indefinitely.
this video is brought to you by the ccp lol get outta here with this fake news propaganda
"At first, I bought the idea, but then one by one they started popping, even putting countdown in days. That was when my skeptism kicks in. This is just a media propaganda."
How is double 3 more likely than double 6? XD
"Youre forgetting one thing. China is china. Lol. They will always have the same problem they had in the past which is why they‚Äôre about to have a collapse, population. How will they feed everyone? They cant. So they lie. Let people die and suffer. This isnt gonna last very long. China is gon china."
I think I first heard 'China is collapsing' about 30 years ago when China economy was a lot weaker than it is now.
"just pointing out: every second words seems like it comes out through your teeth :D , or like a cardboard is being held between you and the mic. Change this and your quality increases ."
Excellent report. I think many YouTubers are putting out wishful thinking or what they think their audience wants to hear.
"China is too big, too many countries owes it money, their workforce is too skilled and too lowcost, they can print endless amount of money but under report the total, its just impossible for them to fail unless the ppl go hungry again like decades ago‚Ä¶ but wtv"
China‚Äôs household share of income to GDP and productivity isn‚Äôt really rising that much. While household debt to income is sky rocketing. What effect will a real estate crisis will have on this?
"B..b..b..but what would happen with those ""the world economics will collapse, market chaos everywhere, we are heading to nuclear war era"" propaganda. I mean it's on the media it must be true, right?"
Thanking for addressing these annoying click bait videos polluting my YouTube feed.
"More bad news coming out of China's economy, this video doesn't look like it'll age well."
"So China has some massive issues, but the government can probably spend their way out of them, but at the same time, if they fail to do so, then it will come crashing down HARD."
"Another important difference is that China's industrial population and agricultural population overlap greatly. 
A large number of peasants left their land to work in the citiesÔºàpeasants‚Äò total number is over 65% of their whole populationÔºâ
When there are economic problems and unemployment problems, these people can directly return to their own land.
At least they have their own small piece of land and house to avoid worse social problems
This is actually a kind of social security system
We must not forget China's Communist foundation‚Äî‚Äî their land was distributed equally to the peasants"
Subscribed. NL accent?
"Massive real estate crisis, banking crisis, education crisis, tourism crisis, wealth crisis, electricity crisis, drought crisis, support crisis, political crisis, manufacturing crisis, stock market crisis, railroad debt crisis, coal crisis, covid crisis.

China is fine. Your social rating has increased."
the west has been predicting collapse for china since the 1960's
Well done but serpentza was first
"I think the most important thing is 5:34 - ""China's goverment popped the bubble itself"""
"obvious juss a chinise shill, lol im not falling for that"
Western companies are moving massive amounts of work out of China. That‚Äôs a fact. This is going to damage their economy. Zero covid is a dumb idea.
Just one more month and china will collapse bros!?
A CCP that enjoys total control over Chinese society will just keep the economy running by resorting to increasingly creative ways of watering down the wealth of its citizens. A slow decline or stagnation as the author describes at the end of the video is therefore much more likely than a sudden collapse!
"'China, COLLAPSING!' sure Business Basics that's why you're posting and repeating the same thing every day"
"Haven't even watch the video. I laughed so hard at the title! ü§£ Been getting so much videos with ""China will collapse in X days"" in my recommended that this one caught me by surprise.
Been having ""are we there yet?!"" feelings over these thumbnails."
I wonder how much the Chinese government paid this man to do this video?
Their masters will let their people eat weeds and there will be no complaints
this man side with chinaü™§
"I feel like you glossed a bit over 3 facts: China's real-estate bubble is several times bigger than 2007's USA, there is a massive hidden inflation due to money""stashed"" in matrasses in China rather than existing digital, and there are incredible amounts of corruption in banking, housing, military and every other facet of China's system."
"I think the CCP will do whatever it takes to stop a collapse, but possible that China does. 

I hope the CCP prevents a collapse as it would hurt the whole world, but would be great if China goes into a slow decline for decades."
"There are 2 more big issues Chins is dealing with. A huge banking scandal occurred that essentially disruptrd the whole banking system, also I learned recently that they're transit system is also a bubble in danger of popping. The transit system is 1 trillion I debt.

China is smart, but they also cheated they're way to success. 
You're right that China probably wont collapse, but dang is everything bad over there right now."
Blink if you‚Äôre in danger.
"LOL, come on, who the fuck in humanity would just watch youtube videos about whether China is collapsing or not. For real, if you want to know what happened, go to some credible website. This is youtube, everyone can post their ideas about something here, this is like asking your dog to analyze the economy, which is ridiculous as fuck, I do admit China has economic issues related to living qualities and shits, but like why would anyone just say it is collapsing."
the EURO is more of a concern
The only thing he hasn't factored in is that Europe and the US going into a recession will put further pressure on their economy
"These yters are just a part in western propaganda. Most of the reason are existing but their extent is totally over blown.
And no I'am no China fanboy I hate the ccp but we shall stay realistic

Ps: I go even further in the next two decades the Chinese currency will become the reserve currency. See Ray Dalio"
At worse they will be like russia in My eyes just stagnant and slowly just fade away.
Paid for
"Tbf China and US are both growing unsustainably with their debts piling up. But they are both too big to fail, one of them failing would be devastating to world trade and economy. I‚Äôm not so sure abt the us but China is growing partly cause of their fiscal policies through infrastructure but they are running out of infrastructure to build so their economy is deemed to slow down."
"it's propaganda lmao, we are living in weird times."
"It looks like you're failing to consider age demographics due to China 1 child policy.  They have no young adults to generate consumption.  They also do not have enough natural resources to sustain their population (food, oil).  They are getting gutted by emerging markets."
"When beijing and other cities have home value to earnings ratios in excess of 40-50x earnings and the real estate market is such a large part of gdp i see no way how it cant pull back signficantly. Its a property bubble multitudes larger than anything the rest of the world has seen. A healthy ratio (at least in the US) is roughly 2.6 - 3.5 to 1. IE if you make 100k, a home price of 260k-350k is considered ideal. I dont think they will ""collapse"", but i think there will definitely be some lasting economic pain that will be hard to cure."
The people doomsaying China are actually talking about the U.S.
"What a surprise! an out of hand dismissal of a crisis by a capitalist, the species of human who is incapable of imagining anything but the current status quo. the exact sort of moron who continually drive our society off cliffs because they know theyll be fine, personally. seems legit to me!"
"So quite a few oversimplications in this video. Russia never really implemented strict capital controls, and capital is absolutely fleeing in droves, I know myself since I've helped numerous relatives move their wealth out of Russia through Turkey.

The video seems to mistake a stable ruble exchange rate with the russian economy. The main reason why its currency has not gone to zero has more to do with draconian fiscal policy that will massively impact growth in the long term. They hiked interest rates to 20% and implemented a rule requiring companies dealing in foreign currencies to exchange 80% of their holdings to rubles. They're also trying to force everyone to buy their oil using Rubles. While good for stoking nationalism, these policies are footguns in basically every aspect.

We're projecting a year by year GDP drop of over 12% in the best case, despite them making a big deal of having a budget surplus. Russia is currently experiencing a historic drop in output, and is only superficially propped up by elevated energy prices. We like to joke that this surplus is mainly caused by the oligarchs not being allowed to steal everything for the first time ever.

But! You are obviously right in that China will not collapse.

But that said, they're in for a recession caused by two main drivers: The popping of their real estate industry, which constituted 30% of their GDP, and massively reduced demand from the west. No matter how you slice and dice it, some 80% of their exports go to the west, and average western GDP growth is projected to go slightly negative.

And *SIGH* no, China does not have cash to neither spend or print itself out of this crisis. China is in for massive liquidity crisis, and it will likely last a few years. But it will likely be healthy for the economy in the long run. That said, I strongly suspect we're not going to see any more massive year by year GDP growth when this is all over."
"You haven't mentioned anything about the housing scam, or the banking scam that had left masses of people with all of their money entirely gone, that's why so many people wanted to draw their money out, they were afraid they would suffer the same fate.

You simply can't paint a picture of china's economy without mentioning these two huge factors and the ramifications they have caused, if anything your video is as misleading as the opposite ones you mention"
"China has long term economic issues, not insurmountable short term ones. If anything causes China to collapse it will be their demographics combined with no immigration incentives... But that will take a generation or two."
Finally an actual economist on YouTube.
ridiculous argument of comparison based on very low resolution thinking
"Europe is in more trouble than China ,,,,"
"1. China is stable? (The CCP is focused on stability. Have faith! They got this!)
2. The solution to fixing bank runs--is printing money!
Huh? aren't bank-runs a solution to prevent banks from recklessly gambling other people's money?
*Shrugs* I guess the solution to fixing inflation is probably. . . starving to death."
Good on you bro !! I'm so tired of the western propaganda .
"China has staggering >$600 Billions yearly trade surplus,,,, Best thing it can do it spend the store $ ,,, What‚Äôs the point of collecting paper $ or Euro which r printed in trillions every year ?? China needs to cut taxes so people can have more money in their pocket & end Zero Covid policy"
"The claim that ""China's economy is going to collapse!"" has been predicted for the better part of 25 years and it has never come to fruition."
.... It's not simple for an economy worth 19 trillion to collapse just tat easily.
"China doesn't have the ability to keep bailing out banks - they own debts from other countries that don't have to repay. 
It's also losing so much manufacturing. Companies are fleeing to Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, India and Bangladesh. 
The only reason it had the manufacturing in the first place was because it had tightly controlled its currency - that goes immediately out the window once it starts printing money. Goodbye manufacturing."
His rationale for them not collapsing is that they can just... print more money? Worked for Venezuela and the Weimar Republic lol.
The commies know how to keep it together.
Finally - some logic is used to analyze the problem....
No Empire lasts forever.
"To be fair, you are making the opposite claim, that is, that the Chinese economy won't collapse. 

That almost as a radical position as claiming that it will collapse in 28 days. 

I totally agree with you that these economic problems takes time to have an effect but I think you underestimate the proportions of the problems by a wide margin. 

The question is in what way the Chinese economy will collapse, not if it will. 

They can print money and inflate their way out of it and use their dollar reserves to prop up the value of the renminbi. They have options, but they can't ignore the consequences of their actions."
It is‚Ä¶That doesn‚Äôt mean it will collapse in one day but its definitely doing bad
ü§îüëç
The same YouTubers also said that Russia wasn‚Äôt going to invade Russia. It‚Äôs pathetic how these so called ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù have no knowledge of how foreign economies work differently.
"CCP boys can spam all they like, you don‚Äôt fool anyone.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"It's much worse than just an economic collapse. China is a chronic net importer who without help (eg trade security guarantees) can't feed its own population, has a lack of allies, a ridiculously insular CCP, a dependency on markets who are half a world away, and an inability to protect its own trade routes. 

China may no longer be able to be a 'manufacturing superpower' if it can't run its factories due to covid, lack of coal, or lack of other base materials. This is only one scenario of many very catastrophic ones. It has collapsed over and over again through history."
"Collapsing: No.
Going to be seriously painful for China's ""middle class"" and everything beneath it as a confluence of adverse events and policy directions occur at the same time.: Absolutely."
The china bull run incoming
"Recently, Honda announced that it will produce all its products outside of China, except for those destined for China. This is just one example of the recent trend of companies moving factories out of China to diversify risk. I think Corona was one of the reasons. There appears to be no doubt that the Chinese economy is headed for a slow decline."
"Trust me, its different this time. China is different."
Chinese shill!
"If this is a youtube comment, you would get replies like:
""Your social credit +999"" or ""shut up ccp bot"" üòÇ"
JUST SUBBED Its nice to see someone who doesn't over hype things...
The amount of misinformation regarding China that is spread these days is insane. Thank you for making this video to inform people on what is really happening.
finallly an unbiased review. Personally i was waiting to comment on those sites after those days passed
"China been around for over 5,000 years USA less than 300 years lol"
"China's economy is not going to collapse in a month but it is collapsing and at an accelerating speed.  Everything said in this video show that you know the US economy very well but know very little about China's economy and how the CCP runs the country. I noticed you rely on selective ""news"" as the source of your ""facts"".  Can't blame you.  Unless you have lived in China enough time, you wouldn't konw."
What about the imminent Chinese sovereign debt crisis (defaults and collapse of countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan) and mass power outages due to drought limiting power output of damns? Also should probably factor the zero Covid policy as well
"so many of these anti China youtube channels, and while their government is well deserving of criticism I feel they give an incredibly biased view of the country"
I've seen other videos on this. The click bait ones talk so damn fast you cannot comprehend what they're trying to tell you and put far too many graphs for you to absorb it all. Videos like these are well made and give the viewer just enough information to understand it all. I think the biggest threat to every economy is inflation. In the U.S. it's slowly going down as are gas prices but it's a world wide effort to bring it down as well. China will probably be doing damage control for the next few months but I don't see the entire system collapsing. Unless inflation goes through the roof China should weather this.
"Unless you do not have active businesses or operational factories in China you or any other youtubers has no idea what they are talking about and  everything is just a guess.
Situation inside the nation is apocalyptic. Yes nations like America or Japan have seen such depressions and I am sure most of us here have studied those events.
But this isn‚Äôt your run of the mill economic depression. 

Funds weren‚Äôt just disappearing from your bank accounts. Cities weren‚Äôt just kept in the dark for days to allow factories to operate at 50% capacity. 
And this is just scratching the surface.

This is like a super natural disaster where everything is starting to rain down at the same time. And there‚Äôs no escaping it. 

Yes it‚Äôs easy to call China collapse a BS or to say China will collapse in 30 days lol. But it‚Äôs all speculation based on ‚Äúdata‚Äù. Zero idea of the ground reality."
"Tech Crackdown, Covid lockdowns, Major foreign companies pulling out, The banking crisis, The power shortages/drought/Wildfires shortly after experiencing massive flooding, Current mass civil unrest, General hostility from most nations surrounding it.

I give the china collapse scenario slightly higher probability than you. The fact that so many things all at once have crippled chinas production (the drought is looking ESPECIALLY nasty) on top of the general apathy of global youth towards the established order being magnified like 10x in china leading to a lot of anti CCP movements coming about naturally over and over despite tight censorship. I would probably give this a One in ten.

Them recovering perfectly? One in one-hundred, too much going on from natural factors to outside interference most likely wont allow this.

And I would say the most likely outcome is a smaller non collapse regression. How bad? Who knows."
"Your reasons are both non sequiturs. 

1) China's political system is nothing like the USA in the Great Depression.
Uh, OK. So the only economy that can collapse has to be like the USA in the 30s?

2) China's economy is nothing like other economies that are collapsing, like Sri Lanka.
So if anyone's economy isn't like Sri Lanka's, they can't collapse? Hold on I'm going to the casino, I'm going to bet like not-Sri Lanka. Can't lose!"
"Your right, but it sounds good."
I just love to click doom clickbait videos
"Dude... Really? I what world does just ""creating money"" not cause inflation. If they simply ""creat more money"" so everyone can withdraw their finds then inflation would destroy them."
WOMAO BS.
It has already in the procee of collapsing. The reason you do not see it is because CCP propaganda and media cover up.
Lol pro China video
"Without the high growth model the CCP loses its raison d'etre. 
Therefore, the zero covid measures and the clamping down on tech companies will desist very shortly, especially after the new administration is assured of the next decade in power. 
The double digit growth of the early 2000s is unlikely to return due to the reasons mentioned in the video, but China most likely can sustain a single digit robust growth for the foreseeable future ( assuming the self harming policies are removed)."
"Great, now you're spreading CCP propaganda."
And you forgot CHINA'S GOLD FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES.
Glad I've always listened to your channel. Things cleared up as well as I understood things much better (like again and again about inflation lol)
In simple words the world needs China
Leave it to a Dutch man to debunk nonsense! ;)
"Thoughtful Analysis, keep up the good worküëç"
"It was getting annoying honestly. We get it, you want China to fail but come on."
.
Best analysis thus far on the subject matter.
"The algorithm is also super horny to ram those videos down your throat too. I watched one video on how their housing crisis and aging population could slow down their growth and for the next month I had at least one ""CHINA WILL COLLAPSE"" video on my homepage every time I looked."
FINALLY
Thank you
you are not wrong. but if war does happen in ChinaÔºåall your predictions need to be adjusted.
Very well explained. I am glad we live in a country where we can look at different views and really sense which person or people are really thinking through this situation.
China is literally causing Sri Lanka
"Thank you for busting the clickbait. However, I recommend Serpentza's video on this for more details regarding what China will do to stop this."
This guy is a spy from China
"Horse shit, maybe it won't be the great depression like, but China will fall hard, reason is that the centered economy model, witch you consider as a plus, well is not, reason is that a those are public money."
I get china is hated but its dumb to think there going to collapse in a month
"Yes, China is going to take a beating with its housing, banking and superspeed railway debt problems. No it's not going to fully collapse, and yes an eventual Japanese stagnation scenario is the most likely ending scenario, although there might be a bit more chaos in the short term."
"I've been seeing those videos a lot lately and I'm just wondering if it's really just cold war type propaganda. Every country has economic slowdowns, China has had many in the past as well. That doesn't mean theirs or anyone's economy will just implode in a matter of days üòÇ"
Also the one child policy was removed ~7 years ago.
"China is having a rough go economically but they've got some tools in their pocket. Mainly; CHEAP RUSSIAN GAS and OIL.  China will become the largest purchaser of Russian resources in a massive way over the next 5 years and they have Russia over a damn barrel!  Even the Russian space program is being co-opt by China.  Russia needs a large lifeline and China is standing there alone, in a dark alley, smoking a cig, under a single flickering neon light.  China is also the only entity able to produce the high tech components required to maintain a modern civilization in the 21st century!!!  At the same time, China is still the largest producer of finished goods FOR ALL WESTERN ECONOMIES!!!  What's stopping China from effectively laundering money for Russia?  NOTHING!!!  China says ""good night"" to Russia and walks through the club's back alley door and into the VIP lounge, sits down at the rectangular card table, takes a minute to eyeball his Chinese corporate minions and splashes the pot with Billions of $ in Russian Rubles.  After divvying up their Rubles, the minions leave the VIP lounge, take a seat in the front row and make it rain for Candy Capitalism's big night."
Been waiting for this ....thank you ... A very neutral explanation
"Subbed, we need more ideology-free analysis like this!"
finance youtubers think everything is going to collapse lol
The clickbaiting reaching levels that shouldn't be possible.
"So that's why companies are always complaining about how notorious difficult it is to get money out of china. A Chinese guy told me that its difficult to get money out of china because they were spooked by Russia's shock therapy after the USSR collapsed and South East Asian's financial crisis in 1997. So they always have to be on guard against AMERICAN CAPITAL ATTACK. It sounded like a conspiracy theory to me, but it seems useful when facing a financial crisis.

 On a side note its kind of interesting that George Soros can appear in both American and Chinese conspiracy theory's, he's the Puppet Master behind the scenes. Most of it is probably just Anti-Semitism, but he must be doing something right if so many people fear and hate him at the same time. I've barely heard of the guy before conspiracy theory's became a thing."
Those clickbait thumbnails are designed to pander to the anxieties and insecurities of White Americans tbh. Nobody who has friends and family in China believes these false realities.
They literally create everything ..china is no little shop
These people are on CIA payroll
how much did it cost?
"Soooo convincing and up to the point! ‚òùüèª

However, I have to admit it made me somewhat sad at the same time, though... as I really hoped the Chinese economy would collapse as long as it's run by such a totalitarian ruthless regime üòû

Anyway... I think a lot of us are looking forward to an update on:

Who's winning the economic war: Russia or the west? 

...any time soon! üôè"
"Counter point videos. Thank you very much  for this video. Honestly, EUA and Europe societes  are the ones  on their way towards total collapse this winter"
"I've seen so many of these ""China is collapsing"" videos all around YouTube and I have been heavily doubting that such a huge economy could crash so violently and so fast.

Sure, it would be pretty convenient if they did crash, and they have been facing some issues, but is it really all that more significant that the various economic issues that western economies are facing? No economy is unshakable, but I'd wager China is probably not *that* fragile."
THE CCP WILL LAST FOR 3000000000000 YEARS!!!! IT CANNOT FAIL THE CCP IS FOREVER.
"It feels like the main reason you get so many videos like that is more ""pushing a political agenda"", so they cherrypick their evidence and fail to view the whole picture"
It just did
"Another misconception to clear up is the state of the real estate sector in China.  

First off, real estate is not a grotesquely oversized segment of the Chinese economy.  Many people like to say things like real estate is 40% of the Chinese economy.  What they mean to say is that in the broadest sense possible of qualifying things as real estate related 40% of the annual growth of the Chinese economy could be classified as real estate related.  If you look at the actual composition of Chinese GDP it looks no different than that of any typical OECD country.  Real Estate and Residential Construction (about 10-15% combined) is not a significantly larger segment of the economy than that of OECD economies.  What this tells you is that real estate used to be a very undersized segment of the Chinese economy.  It went from being undersized to now being about the right size (when benchmarked against OECD countries) through a period of very rapid growth (when it grew much faster than all other industries).  The fact that real estate has not yet become oversized relative to the rest of the economy means that the Chinese government is not late but rather on time in coming now to cool the growth in their real estate sector.

Second off, Chinese real estate is not in a huge asset price bubble.  The reason Chinese real estate prices are falling is not because buyers are overstretch or that buyers don't have the purchasing power to buy homes.  The current fall in home prices is due to a loss of confidence in real estate sellers.  The real estate sellers being unable to meet the demand from buyers resorted to cheating the buyers by taking their money and either not delivering the homes they promised or significantly delaying the provision of these homes or significantly reducing the quality of these homes.  That is the current problem in the market.  The government has forced the hand of these real estate seller by making  them come clean to the buyers rather than stall this situation out until it gets even worse.  They want the sellers to clear the market with the buyers by halting construction of new homes, then finishing and delivering the already promised homes as close as possible to the original promises.  The sellers will be made to take as much of the hit as possible before the government steps in to make any remaining short changed home buyers whole.  This is a big mess that has to be cleaned up over time.  Until it is resolved the real estate market cannot function normally and buyers will be in a state of distrust of sellers.  This means that both transaction volumes and prices will fall until the problem is resolved.  However the fundamentals are such that there is still much more demand than supply.  In fact the current problem will make that imbalance even worse.  So after this problem is over, real estate prices will probably recover and go even higher.  Ultimately one day supply could be more than demand due to demographic factors and real estate prices could fall but that is far out into the future given how slowly demographics come to pass."
"While I commend this site for not jumping on the whole ""China's economy will collapse in X number days!"" horse-puckey craze going around on the internet,  I found this analysis missed several key critical elements.  China's dependence on its manufacturing base is to smooth its economic collapse is vastly overstated.  The assumption is the past will hold in the future.  China's covid response with massive shut, lockdown events that stopped all manufacturing in China and precipitated the world's current ""pipeline"" problems exposed to all worldwide business leaders that depending on China and its authoritarian, communist government as part of their business strategy was just playing with fire with an inevitable end of when, not if, they would force their totalitarian ways on the world's economies.  There are other Asian economies just as capable with low labor costs without the risks of dealing with the CCP where businesses will shift their manufacturing.  So China's economy will not only suffer in the short-term with their lock-down policies but also long-term as business shift manufacturing to more stable, less unpredictable countries.  This instability comes from the incompatible nature of China's CCP communist-style government and the free-market reforms they needed and allowed to generate economic growth needed for feeding and employing the large shift in populations from agriculture to industrial, country to city migration they experienced.  It's like trying to become a little bit pregnant.  This manifested in the real estate crisis they are currently seeing.  The communist party could not allow financial markets to exist like in the rest of the 1st world because of their need to control everything.  The newfound wealth generated by those Chinese citizens allowed to participate in free market capitalism was only allowed one avenue to invest - the real estate market.  They were not allowed to move their money to off-shore investments and the CCP does not allow for an investment economy.  Now add this the long, deep, deep CCP/Chinese culture of graft and their whole economy collapse was inevitable and it cannot be compared to first-world country events of a similar nature.  In short, you can't compare free-market economic adjustments - recessions and depressions - with closed, central planned/controlled economies which the CCP favors at its core.  Humans respond in predictable ways to this type of forced behavior - just look at China's ""lie flat"" and ""let it rot"" movements spawned by the CCP's failed experiments with forces they fear."
CCP pays you well :)
You are correct. Stagnation is most likely.  Let's  hope political system doesn't make the situation much worst

"Ah, yes, the ""the government will certainly do the right thing"" hypothesis.  Just like how the Fed made all the right decisions on inflation over the past couple years."
Nonsense.
Very good coverage! I love how you cover things from various perspectives and try to be honest and unbiased! Keep up the amazing work!

"Thank you!  This is so ridiculous.  They have crisis maybe, but it‚Äôs ridiculous.  These people have never been to China."
"While I do agree that most of the ""China's economy will fall in x number of days"" videos are hilarious, I find your coping just as amusing, China's bubble is indeed going to burst very soon and we all are going to feel it, that being said the question is not when, but how hard it will hit the rest of us. It seems like both sides are missing a vital part of their economy, the human factor and it does seem like that factor is hell of a thing currently as armored vehicles are guarding their banks. The funny thing is that China's 1 child policy will be end end of their economy, not some foreign investors leaving the market, not some 1 trillion+ $ in debt, but the fact that the younger generation (mostly guys) are extremely ""done"" with the whole system and it only requires 1 Tiananmen-like debacle for it to all crumble and fall, not the just the economy, but the CCP as a whole."
"A lot of people who watch those ""China will collapse"" videos use them to defend their own xenophobic views. Many even WANT China to collapse which is quite horrific. Since it's a weird concept to wish something like that to millions of people.."
"Neither, I think. China always can find the other way, maybe similar but other way."
"üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ I like how you are upsetting the Anti-China ""Expert"" crowd."
"You have left out probably the most important way in which the Chinese government can support its currency.  Which is to repatriate the capital that it has already sent abroad.  People have this mistaken notion that there are no capital flows from China to the rest of the world and that where these capital flows happen they are just rich private citizens moving their money out of China under the radar.  This is not true.  China is the largest net capital exporter in the world and has been for decades.  It has built up a vast portfolio of holdings of foreign assets.  We can only speculate as to how much this is because asset ownership in the world is mostly opaque due to the facts that most assets in the world trade over the counter and there is an entire accounting industry that exists to hide the ultimate ownership of assets to outsiders.  Add to this the fact that the Chinese government controls thousands of large state owned entities with which they can use to buy and hold foreign assets.  Making it that you would have to chase down the asset ownership of each of these these entities to find out what the Chinese government owns.

From the trade flows that we can see over the years we can come to a rough guess that the Chinese government probably owns, on net, many trillions of dollars of foreign assets.  Hence the Chinese can potentially repatriate many times more capital than what could conceivably leave.  So the Chinese have far more dry power to spend into their economy than anyone in the world.  Probably even more than the US.  

When you see the Chinese Yuan fall against the US dollar you should not think that that is anything other than by design.  To achieve the trade policy that the Chinese government envisions the Chinese Yuan has to respond to the Euro and Yen and other currencies falling by so much against the dollar.  It can't just stay stubbornly pegged to the dollar when China does so much trade with economies other than the US."
You demand your money back and all you get is tanks and brute squads beating people.  Isn't communism great!
"Anyone that trusts Chinese economic statistics is a fool. I have some gold plated copper bars for you. 
The country is unbelievably corrupt.
The belief that  a massive bureaucracy that is corrupt at every level can centrally plan and successfully run an economy is ridiculous."
"The ‚ÄúChina collapse in x days‚Äù stories are obviously bs, but I‚Äôm not so optimistic about the short to mid term future of the Chinese economy.

The collapses that we have seen have shown billions in paper gains supported by pretty much nothing, and lots of corruption. Being an spaniard I‚Äôm very well versed in overspending and corruption, and it is *never* a localized problem. 

I‚Äôm expecting the hole to be way bigger that what we have seen, we will have to see the real size as troubles and defaults propagate through the economy.

Of course the biggest concern here has more to do with politics than economics though. So far China has been able to do things unthinkable in western countries because continuous growth built trust in the government. I‚Äôm not sure this kind of trust will be long lasting, especially in times of hardship and monetary expansion. The consequences here are way less clear."
"""Let it rot"""
Money manipulation is China masters of
"What is missing here is a discussion of the fact that around 30% of the GDP is connected to the housing market, in contrast in the US where it was around 15-18% [edit: had to correct this number] I think and further that there was a ponzi scheme on building houses, where people gave money without receiving their houses yet and now all that money is gone."
Chinese Politics will tear itself apart
GTF out of here. China indeed will not collapse because its economy is a lie driven by CCP. If CCP decide not to collapse it will not collapse.
Very good
"The Great Depression happened because tge Federal Reserve wasn't printing enough money even though they had enough gold to back it up. So it was the Central Bank's incompetence. So it wasn't a natural event, it was man made."
I would never want to live in a country like China who follows every little thing you say and do. If you say something negative about the govtthey will arrest your family members to make you do what they want.
I find many youtube video on China to always be poorly researched or ideology compromised.
"by the way ...""extremely difficult to get money out of china"" is relativ to the massive growth of the asian neighbours  nations who are well knowing how to create progressive corporative-based money laundry tools =small chinese selfmade millionaires get easy out and invest their amounts out of china to increase private treasure for their own without fearing future threats from the comunist party...."
"Well, it kinda is collapsing, but it wont.matter because of the control state of.the ccp."
"Lol I'm not defending ""China collapsing in X days"" however youre suggesting hyperinflation as the solution to save the banks and claim China's collapsing manufacturing sector as the proof for monetary independence being able to save China from collapse. 

One look at your channel you are just another anti western bullshit artist with a graphics budget. I hope China follows your plan to hyperinflate the economy. Please keep suggesting this üòÇ"
"This guy doesn't explain why China can get the money to spend it's way too safety. All that I know is either China has enough money stored away, They're going to print more money , they're going to increase taxes or go in debt"

"We should consider China‚Äôs lack of water and current drought. Banking won‚Äôt collapsed China, it‚Äôs gonna be natural resources."
"FALSE ARGUMENTS. Just because China doesn‚Äôt look like other failing countries doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt failing. China is the only country of its kind and doesn‚Äôt have the security measures in place certain countries do. Meaning, when it starts to fall, there is no stopping it."
I hope the CCP collapse
"That sounds reasonable. Since China loves to say they control taiwan, I would like to see if a japan-like stability would still have a high probability to happen if the CCP attacked taiwan and try to seize it officially through war(as they want and brainwash their citizens into thinking it is a reality already),  as this also has a high probability to happen."
Very true
Many companies moving their businesses out of China because of extreme regulations from their communist govt and much higher labor cost than how it was before. Companies which continue producing goods in China will run out of business because they have to sell products higher than companies producing goods elsewhere In Vietnam India Thailand and many other countries

"I'd agree that titles people have made are sensationalist and, being real, probably even aren't meant literally by the half of them, it's just this sort of internet culture we're all subconsciously caught up in where we hyperbolize our statements to get a point across.

*However*

I think a very important caveat is seen within the three problems listed towards the end. What your video has done is it highlighted a best-case-scenario response is *possible.* This is from the perspective of perfect, robotic response performance that calmly and pragmatically assesses options for the best response.

....But this isn't the CCP. The CCP has insisted on it's detrimental COVID policy, to my understanding, simply because changing the lockdown policy would be tantamount to admitting to having made a mistake, which is a big taboo in Chinese culture, especially for the government. 

Another great example is you highlighted that China's central bank can easily provide the money people are running to the banks to grab...except it's *not.* There's been plenty of footage and stories of banks denying people their money and practically interrogating them for why they need it, or limiting them to ridiculously low withdraw rates. This itself is a sign China is already not going along with the scenario you've provided.

I think the problem we're most likely to encounter is that the CCP is unlikely to do anything that openly showcases mistakes on it's behalf, and may also be reluctant to do anything that makes them look weak or incompetent. 

The missing factor in your analysis is basically the exact thing macroeconomics doesn't teach: the culture. China is *culturally* also in a tough position at the moment because people are growing increasingly annoyed with it's policies, it's misinformation (for example, the heat waves have refused to show temperatures above 40 degrees despite foreign apps reporting higher temperatures), how it backed down after Pelosi visited Taiwan didn't help, and in general it's clear China is just not doing as well as it claims it's doing. The CCP needs to find a way to remedy the problem *without* provoking the ire of the masses, so currently I think things such as simply bailing out the banks without any sense of justice is ""easier said than done.""

Another note: even if China were to do the things you say, it would devalue Chinese currency due to the extra amount they've printed. This looming threat makes China a currently unstable market to invest in, and that combined with the unpredictable lockdowns means yes, plenty are pulling out or downsizing their Chinese involvement. 

There's also a number of X factors such as their incredible drought they'd experienced, how that combined with worldwide inflation might effect the masses, etc etc. 

I digress though. Point is: China is still in a terrible position right now and it's not exclusive to the economic problems. The climate problems, the cultural problems, the instability problems, the political problems and the economic problems all mean at the very least, China is a currently a very unstable and unpredictable trade partner, so we can expect downsizing from foreign investors, devaluing of their own currency and a recession from them at the *minimum.* They doin bad lol"
Wait... oh shit!
"China will still fade away , and India will be the new ."
I'd love to hear you debate Peter Zeihan over this topic.  Great viewpoints here.
Thanks for the sober analysis. I keep seeing those thumbs and I've been skeptical but lack the background.
"While I doubt China will collapse in a complete heap crying into their soup... I don't see a highly managed get out of jail free scenario either. It has to do with Chinese methodology rather than the available pathways mostly leading to Japanese style scenario. 

Japan,still has one thing China does not. It has skills in out of the box thinking and capacity for quick change. It's population value independent thought and new ways of thinking it is a highly technologically motivated mindset and not just a copy cat using the advances of others like for example ancient Rome. 

That didn't stop the slow painful decline, but it did stop it from being a lot worse. Japan diversified and as trained by their administration overlords they adopted free thinking models to grab at other pathways.

China has a different culture where corruption is not only endemic it's been baked into the culture for millennia. Also even the idea of teaching kids in kindergarten to value their individuality and personal skills and capacity is horrifying to the CCP and Chinese population. 

I think they are more likely to be pulled by gravity into collapse. Which given the lever they do have, that they are prepared to use, will halt a cataclysm.... But will also lead to a deep recession. Maybe as long as ten years...but more likely 5 then leveling out to not being the world's factory, yet still a relatively important  player.

They can certainly put dreams of taking Taiwan, along with belt and road initiatives into the bin. Those are not likely to be a thing now. They have peaked and it's all downhill from here."
"The problem with china economy is that nobody borrow shit since nobody go out of their home and nobody work either 
So ita more of a missmanagement of macro economic because political need surpas economic need something stupid that all socialist seem to so"
Business Basics is a terrible channel. There's nothing to learn from there. It's just an anti-china click bait channel
For most YouTube economics commentators their view of any economic situation in the world is heavily colored if not entirely derivative of their political identity and a historical retelling that feeds that identity.  The same westerners who claim China is a house of cards are the same people who say we have given to much of our industrial base to China!  These are the same people who also claim nothing is backing the dollar and we aren‚Äôt productive materially anymore yet decry China as the next great global hegemony because well they make everything lol.    China is rising and Anglos are mad y‚Äôall.
the Racists and China haters are out in Full force!!!          so SAD!!
"Why I nobody talking about the Ughyr and Tibetan genocide going on right now?

If France was doing it, people wouldn't stop talking about it"
I've heard you can see China's economy from space.
lol yeah it is
I beg you make a video comparing china's economic progress and the expectations of projected economical growth.. You will see China is slowing down at an exponentially increasing dive. Then you will see what is inevitably happening.
"I have seen just has many videos claiming China won't collapse has videos claiming it will collapse. It's diolitical. Those  are some good points this vidio has covered, however Apple doesn't gamble and has shifted its iPhone Busness to India dispite Black Rock claiming billionaires should invest heavily in China. 

Where there's smoke there's usually fire. But on the other hand if the economic form falls China would just create another one. 

Also comunisim and socialism are interchangeable. What I am saying is Globilists governments in western Europe including Australia and New Zealand all get there orders from Beijing. CCP own them.

 China seams to be unsinkable. It even owns half of India and the Democrats. That means it owns half of America.
After the rigging of the elections it will own all of America. 
So what can go wrong?

Plenty! First mistake was to reveal there insanity to there own people stripping the middle class of everything they had worked for.
1% has all the money and are all communist party members.
99% of the population are now poor and are trying to escape big brother totalitarianism communist rule.
A heat wave like nothing that has come before is burning China to the ground. China unsinkable?
They said that about the Titanic.
China will sink! It's just a matter of when."
"EVERYONE here is probably wrong. The spiral of death by the debt/credit game is something that doesn't care if you produce 1/5th of the goods in the world. It was designed to be a total failure and to conduct to a terrifying Marxism social state. Wake up guys, we're going to face something way bigger than we can even imagine."
"The Chinese GDP have a positive growing every year, the US GDP have years of negative growth. And every financial institution says that the Chinese economy will only slow down and is for the obvious reasons the financial situation everyone is living.
Those financial ""influencers"" are probably payed by the US government like the tiktoker a few months ago. But it good to see the masks of those ""influencers"" falling"
"After 2008 crisis,i have heard a ton of people saying China will collapse and so on but what happen,they thrive to become one of the world powerful country.And now the nonsense of many so called ""expert""  saying China will collapsed in 15-28 days,what the hell are they talking about........."
Citizens are refusing to pay mortgages and they are currently in a bank run... Yet you are trying to compare the US collapse to this Chinese collapse. Why are you doing that... The fact of the matter is china's economy is VASTLY SLOWING DOWN. you have shifted the topic into a comparison.. That is not what this is about. THIS IS ABOUT CHINA'S ECONOMY NOT MEETING EXPECTATIONS AND SLOWING DOWN DRAMATICALLY. It can no longer sustain itself as it currently is.
I bet it caused huge headache & huge setbacks‚Ä¶ but i dont think its gonna be a collapse üòÖ i mean big countries dont fall just like tht.. even after many economic crisis‚Ä¶ countries go on.  At least tht what i think üòÖ
"Well this 11min is kinda way too long and miss the point. Your did your analysis on the standpoint of a liberal democracy (like these hypes youtubers). Even if China economy would collapse, the CCP just don't care. If people are unhappy and goes on the streets and start protesting, the CCP will have no problems sending in the tanks and killing a couple thousand to calm the rest. An economic collapse means nothing to the CCP and a Totalitarian state. Economic collapse is a problem in a liberal democracy because of the political unrest & unstability that follows most of the time. ex : Weimar Republic, Sri Lanka, Argentina, etc... North Korea has been in an economic slump for the past 30 years and I can tell you that the gov & state is still working normally for the past 30 years."
"I never believed those collapse stories, for the reason you cite mostly. But I would say it this way, their economy is a real one, not based on credit. People work and produce things that can be used internally and exported, so they won't collapse, even if their banking sector or whatever speculative sector collapse. It won't matter for the average person there, only foreign investors perhaps.

As for the long term, I believe they will still grow, but since the West is collapsing, it might stagnate in a way, but having less population, it should not be a big issue, they will just produce less. Their growth will be mostly internal, it's what they are aiming for anyway. Develop their own internal markets. Less export, more internal consumption, which will be a kind of growth. More high end products in things they are investing in, like medicine, robotic, green energy. I don't think they will stop growing and they won't have too many competition. Demographics are destiny pretty much. In theory all things equal, they should be 5 times the size of the US in terms of economy, so there is place to grow."
"Wow, now the trending video is not about sacred Ukraine and the collapse of Russia, but about Taiwan and the collapse of China."
Oh my god see the entire topic of your discussion is completely wrong we are not comparing economic crashes we are stating china's economy is fuked. What in the hell are you talking about.
Let‚Äôs not forget that Chinese people are now starting to stop paying their mortgages and as well banks have stopped letting their people from taking money out from their accounts and even froze their bank accounts.
Yes its collapsing ether u like it or not it's all done on purpose to unleash the great reset listen to what the wef said there goal is collapse society us we know it
"So what I fear about this collapse is that, we are human. This video‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs very rational and not telling of feeling but that‚Äôs the problem with how this video presents itself and I just can‚Äôt trust that we see it as ok while China honestly has not changed from 2020s COVID feelings so think about that try and go to work but you had to still be in lock down mood from 2020 so tell me how that feels. They have very little freedom to go outside and now very little ways to make money because of it. I hope we do ok üòÖ"
"Idk if Chinas economy will collapse, but their policies caused famine were millions died, that good economy certainly collapsed. Their policies killed billions of wild animals that destroyed their biodiversity, the natural economy collapsed. It's not a surprise that their idiot policies would cause financial ruin. It's not that they're smart, they just make a lot of money and hold poltical monopoly, shitty ideas can survive a long time in those conditions"
this is Chinese propaganda
Have to remember China guards the value of their currency - they control it completely.  So they can print as much as they like internally and the value will remain the same pretty much. They will have to address their issues with corruption within their banking system (i.e. how they handle loans) and the realtor market sector needs a major overhaul.  They let it run like this because of huge need for housing.  My guess? The Chinese govt already knew this was coming and have a gameplan to get them out of it.  I doubt they will go through a Japanese stagnation either. It'll be a minor slump if any unless something really weird goes down in the country (i.e. like real revolutionary war type stuff with the citizens).  So.. it'll be business as usual for them. Meanwhile here in the U.S.....? Yea not so much I think.
"09:50 China learned from Japan, it won't make the same mistakes it made."
"Banks failing, Housing Market Collapse, Highest Unemployment in 30 Years. Covid Shutdowns daily destroying industry. Exodus of Foreign Manufactures [the foundation of China economic boom over the past 30 years] Yuan being Heavily Devalued.

Nothing to see here! Move along!"
"China isn't gonna collapse, but it definitely is done growing for awhile. the situation in China is simple. do not invest in China right now. plain and simple. do not put money in companies that rely on China. China is in an age similar to the US in the 80's. and it can go one of many ways, however right now the safe and smart are watching from the sidelines."
69 days
For me it was a great way to remove nonsense youtubers from my feed
"China is fundamentally different from the Western Liberal economic Theories, because thats all they are. Due to the centralized structures and a different view on property rights it will probably turn out as a reinforcement of state policy but far from even a 2008 style recession"
"I think that looking at Korea, Taiwan and Japan, its likely China will have a relative stagnation relative to the US (stop catching up) but not at 15-20% of US per capita GDP levels, but probably at twice or thrice that level. Growth will almost certain slow down, but if Japan and Korea shed any light on this, it should remain above US average for a couple more decades."
"Tbh China's position looks bleak as fuck
Just because of the 1 child policy they will have a massive problem (unless they move retirement age to like 98 or smh)
""Leting it rot"" movement amongst the young doesn't help it either
Given how china's work culture looks I'd say they will be economically pegged without consent"
An economy like that dont care what others say about them. You rather let your rivals think you are weak gentlemen
Thank you. Didn't watch the vid but thank you. God bless
china gave us c-19 dont forget the jahres of struggle you had
Finally a different narrative will fallow you
"*BRILLIANT ANALYSIS*  I study China from a philosophical and history perspective and the ""Japan style stagnation"" is by far the most likely as it is kinda planned for - its what they want

their goal is a steady state economy - zero growth - servicing the internal market - big enough to NOT be bullied by the USA - zero poverty - happy society - no violence - distributed wealth
*THEY ARE NOT A CAPITALIST COUNTRY - AND THEY HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT IDEA OF THE WORLD TO THE WEST - THEY JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE*"
"Yes. China and Japan economies are the most misunderstood by western analysts. 
The potential US economy collapse of GFC in 2008 was due to overdriven fractional reserve system in the banking sector. Not the demand in property sector itself. And this was because US economy run by bankers. Which is not the case with China. While similar on the surface, Chinese govt can very well afford to let the troubled developers or banks go bust. In worst case scenario, CCP can ask PBoC to just 'print' more money and lend it, or just nationalize the troubled companies, and finish the projects. 
And China can do that because it has plenty of foreign reserves it has saved for decades to back the newly printed Yuan, without causing inflation that spirals out into hyperinflation due to insufficiency in foreign currency (as in Srilanka's case).
China could even afford to maintain the conversion rate against USD to stay low for decades (which deemed as manipulative by US), because it has oversupply of USD. 

Moreover, the demand in property sector in China is still one of the highest due to cultural factors. And chinese in majority still believe that the best investment is in real estate. Which won't change anytime soon. They just need them to be built and not abandoned by the developer. So it is govt job to ensure this to happen. Which CCP already started doing by implementing and enforcing the 3 red lines rule, which help backstopping the bad practices by the developers, and avoiding banks to be overheated. This intervention may put brakes on China GDP growth as a whole, but won't put it into recession since their growth rate has been much higher than 0% for a long time.
So it is not that Chinese defaulting because they can not afford to pay the mortgage installment , but rather they refuse to pay unless it is completed. And this is completely different with what happened in US subprime sector back in 2008."
And we mourn the loss of this great channel to the narrative moderation overlords in the coming days
Who is wrong or right all we can do is PREPARE and WAIT .
thanks for this video. thinking china is going to functionally collapse seems very naive
Confident  on the market  is not there
I'm personally sick of those alarmists YouTube videos. But I'm more interested to see which ones will delete their videos when the time is up. Like how stupid are these other tubers that they give themselves a deadline. Are they going to drink the kool-aid when the Chinese econopocalypse doesn't happen in two weeks? Jonestown scenario for all the china hawks?
"*THANK YOU...!!!*    I have done a degree in Ancient Chinese philosophy, I am an author on the collapse of civilisations, I have learnt to read Chinese, I am off there next year to write a book...

NO China's economy is not collapsing - China is starting to transition from servicing a global market to servicing its growing domestic market, yes there will be glitches, but it is a managed economy, they can legislate and manipulate away almost any problem. The issue for the west is China is just not that into you any longer...  And that is a HUGE problem - especially for the USA."

The reports of my demise are greatly exaggerated.  Even the ruble is sitting higher than was at the start of the year.

"I love the thumbnails, and the pictures of buildings on fire. Its such great clickbait. I don't take any disaster news seriously any more unless its global warming related"
"Good analysis! To add a few: 1. Chinese treasury debts is in RMB, not USD, so Sri Lanka kind of collapse is impossible;  2. Chinese domestic mkt is huge; 3. political independence lead to financial independence. no Plaza Accord, no lost 20 years like the Japanese economy; 4. cheap Energy reliability from Russia, oil and natural gas ‚õΩ even though chinese economy is a bit slow now, but when zero Covid policy changes, the economy will be on fast track !"
"having seen more than one of those video I have to say that I've enjoyed this one. 
Good arguments and great explanation."
"There are many issues with this video. Just to start with you are just comparing different countries with China, which will not work. You failed to look at the little details within China to get the greater grasp on the situation, while those 'doomsday videos' usually fills in the void with detailed numbers. 

1) Sure China can create cash, but confidence is at a all time low. Currently there are lockdowns all around and shops are hurting. Supply chain for these shops are not producing, and the numbers this year are a fraction of those last year for the up coming holiday seasons when China produced the most. No one is buying, within and abroad.

2) Crackdowns: There are crackdowns on every sector. Property is the biggest tax revenue for CHina, which you failed to touch upon, you just says their biggest problem but dont explain why. Govt here (im in China) generates revenue from land sales to developers. Which developers would inturn would get an IOU from consumers and promissory notes build homes, and if sails dont meet their needs.. The situation is faltering right now. 

3) 3 Redlines. China already ran back from these 3 red lines, but too little too late. Damage has been done. Money into these projects arent doing well. Which in turn new home sales are low. Also 2ndary home sales are also bad. Rent is going down and also prices for homes.

4) Youth unemployment. You failed to talk about unemployment in general but youth unemployment is nearly 24%. THis is huge. The Gao-Kao (their SAT's) is the hardest this year compared to when it was implemented. Reason is to limit kids to getting into college, which is also another issue... Colleges need students to 'work'
 so they would set up students for jobs. Hit's their quotas. Less students means less pressure to keep up with the numbers. 

5) Adults are lying flat and letting it rot. THis is true on many instances. Adults (that i have met) are quitting the rat race. I can see it within China. They dont care to keep up with payments and will work little for their basic needs. 

6) Debt to income ratio. You failed to touch upon this big time. Ray Dalio (even though hes a big proponent on China, his A fund is leveraged within China) talks about debt to income ratio. If follow his principle one can easily see that its nearly impossible for the average salary to own a home here let alone find a mate (Chinese men needs to buy a woman a house and car before marriage, so this alone is eroding Chinese men sentiment).

7) Patriotism/wolf warrior/War. With the downturn of the economy, there needs to bring distraction. Enter Wolf warrior BS. Its a way to distract the masses from the trouble within. But covid 0 and heatwave isnt bring the sentiment needed for the drums of war. It's one mans ambition vs the livelihood of the economy. Infact if 7 was corrected and never implemented all the troubles within China could have been avoided and the economy would be thriving. The upcoming elections a few months away is important for China and the stability of the world. 


You are wrong on many instanced and using other countries/history as context but fail to look at the little nuances China is going through to fully see the picture. China is in a free fall, the bottom we dont know. And right now, my city is giong through lockdowns... So yea im feeling the pressure as im writing this now."
Great video
"I speak Chinese (I am a citizen of Taiwan) and was working in China before the Wuhan virus. Yes, too many hyped up China will collapse videos now, but at the same time I disagree with SO much of this video. 
1) Look up HeNan (and has already spread to Anhui and to a lesser extent the NE) banking crisis. We already have bank runs. Understand that these were local banks and the interests and actions of the local and central (national) government do not always align.  
2) A better country to compare with is perhaps Japan with 30 years of no or very sluggish growth with the real estate worth less than 30 years ago but it was not a bubble that popped and then recovered. 
3) Infrastructure spending is their solution for everything now but is it a solution? The low hanging fruit has already been taken with it so for example high speed train lines and freeways between the big cities have been built. Their debt is already growing and the ROI on such extra spending is likely negative. 
4) the unmentioned elephant in the room of combined effects of a population that will start to retire/kids not being born/INSANE anti-Wuhan virus measures (eg PCR testing freshly caught fish, disinfecting runways, supply chain collapses...). China had been called the factory to the world for a reason but SO many companies I know are getting the hell out. We came back to Taiwan. I have LOTS of enquiries now compared with before from companies in the USA, Australia even Asia to do OEM/ODM manufacturing because they are so frustrated/fed up with the situation in China. Once these companies do move their supply chain out they are unlikely to return to China because they view the risk/instability as too high."
"Quite interesting explanation. Due to this kind of videos i have stopped following those sensationalistic craptubers.

Very sensible to add a probability weight to the scenarios. It would be nice to summarize those"
I 1000% guarantee you this man is not invested in anything Chinese. Gluck and RIP.
"But there is no FDIC equivalent in China. If your bank goes under you just lose everything.
Many Chinese people have already recently.
No way to get money out of the Country. You got me there! (Trillions in goods and services leaving the country)"
"Thank you,  this was a well thought out & explained antidote to the sensationalism that is dominating you tube!  China is certainly in trouble due to its huge amount of debt, therefore  I do see a prolonged retraction/decline (no reason for us to invest), but not a complete ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù of its government!"
"umm this info might be a lil old but the ccp already annouced 
the bail outs
the hanan bank that scammed depositors the ccp said those werent saving account 
but well after a few days the ccp announced they will cover the hanan bank deposits
the mortgage boycott is mostly a problem created by the real estate development firms
so the government didnt want to bail them out but the boycott forced their hands
158 billion has been set a side to finish the projects and the local governments have also seizing control of the unfinished projects to either finish or sell it some who can
so alot of small medium firms have work for the next decade"
"Interesting video but I do believe you left out an very important part of the issues that China is facing currently. The rampant chinese IP theft, military posturing and increase in labour cost has pushed a number of countries and companies to start an exodus of production from China to other countries. Should this continue, which most believe it will, China will no longer be able to rely on It's gigantic production capacity and will have to seek to shift their economy which will be incredibly difficult considering the investments into production capabilities, logistical infrastructure, education and more. Add this to the current issues that China is facing and China is suddently facing a much more bleak financial outlook than just a collapsing realestate sector and an overzealous COVID strategy. The chinese overtures against Taiwan and the moves made in the south china sea will end up cosing China a whole lot more than they bargained for."

"It's hard for China to replace USA as a dominant economy but it will also not going to fall apart so, we can see a new cold War"
For once a different POV
Glory to China!
Think soo!!
"1st:""""China can actually provide the money people would ask for during a bank run.. because they are state controlled thus can print the money""...

Yes so you mean in case of a bank run.. China and get themselves into more trouble by creating Venezuelian like inflation. You just destroyed their economie. However we actually can see how China is preventing a bank run.. They are just preventing people to run to the bank... buying them time. To be honest a much more rational approach because it is in their reach.

However even when preventing the bank run,.. consumer spending is going to suffer and the bank is not out of trouble at all. 

You didn't think this ""alternative"" through at all..

2nd: China is losing manufacturing power in the last years because of Covid-19 lockdowns, Chip shortages and most importantly their own demand shrinking to below baseline because their initiatives where they use their internal demand for are slowing down or event stopped to a hold completely. Other parts of the world are slowing innovating themselves out of the China dependance. I can even say this freely working for one of the largest Freight haulers in the world.. China Freight is slowing down and is proposed to slow down even further. So your claim of ""all time highs"" nope we are seeing large drops in demand because of talk of recession slow down of consumer spending in the west. Don't need to freight cheap junk over if there is no demand for it.  They are going to lose this position by protectionist measures from Europe and America. They had their fun with cheap products, now they are moving towards sustainable circular products. Lowering their growth but improving their core.

Also it is not just the investors fleeing. It is the investments and the production lines. Where newly innovated products are not made in China but more in the West. Meaning China is losing its demand to innovation. We are simply not outsourcing the production of these new innovations. Keeping China in the dark for offering these to the world. And when they steal and offer it.. they get blocked by legislation against Chines driven hardware. Again protectionist actions. 

Conclusion: I do not think your arguments are convincing at all. No one stated a Sri-Lankan style of collapse in ANY of the video's on your feed. So even that comparrison just does not brake it because it was never made,.. or maybe just once but left at that. You also failed to mention the huge depth crisis in the big Chinese initiatives that are going to want to get payment now that they cannot loan any cheaper to buy off older loans. THAT is the largest problem."
"I think the fact that they import most of their oil, and don't have a blue water navy is a serious problem. They are completely dependent on American over watch of the oceans for the tankers to get from the middle east to China.  

It sounds like the Chinese census is cooking the books, making the population of young people look way bigger than it actually is. 

China had to cull their swine herds because of a virus,  and had to restart their entire pork production.

There's more,  but basically these guys are NOT in a good spot geopolitically."

"I think the massive amount of exportation from China is a bit of a lie (currently, not potentially not in the future) with regard to the rest of the world ""needing"" Chinese exports.  
An embargo would absolutely have massive and problematic effects.  But, at least in the US, in the absence of a Asian-Pacific war, we'd still have pretty much everything we need, and would lose a bunch of stuff we don't.  Prices on a number of low and midling value goods would rise as a result of shifting market demand domestically; small engines, filler goods, and small appliances.  Commodities like steel, copper, and lithium-based manufacturing would be short-term shaken, the latter dependent on how China continued to interact with its nearest neighbors, how the various lithium deposits in Mexico and Africa are dispositioned, and whether the US market decides to waste excessive effort on EV tech and inefficienct energy generation.

After re-tooling periods of varying length, the cost-justification makes it an easy decision to bring a bunch of stuff domestic.  And with new capital in an age of automation and AI assistance...the US is standing on a launching pad even greater than China, per capita."
I donno this guy looks a little Chinese to me.
finally a person who understands something.
I see nothing wrong with crackdown on oligarchs and private education. They suck. We need more high quality public education.
"China‚Äôs economy will not collapse, it will just be owned by Xi JinPing‚Äôs Chinese CCP. Shared prosperity and pay Chinese with enslaved salary like Uighur. A lot of foreign companies like Samsung are leaving China for good. Huawei has no more foreign companies to steal IP technologies. Good luck future Chinese peasants (again)."

"""Economists"" have predicted nine of the last four collapses.
One other thought: China doesn't have two or more political parties fighting each other about who will be the boss more than solving problems. Imagine a pro sports team fighting themselves internally."
"This is an interesting take on the China mortgage crisis. But I honestly never took those clickbait titles literally, I never actually believed that China would collapse within 27 days, lol. I assumed it was just the classic hyperbolic ""please click me"" rhetoric that Youtube loves to reward.

But I feel this video really isn't taking into account the social unrest brewing in the country. I know you're an economist and maybe that's beyond your scope...but there are protests all over and they are directed at the Government. Surely this will play a factor? What if another Tiananmen square happens? Do you think the government is really gonna going to be able to suppress the unrest? People have access to the internet nowadays, its not like it was all that  time ago. I think you're prediction depends heavily on the CCP maintaining their authoritarian grip on the country.

They have yet to pump enough money into these banks so people can actually pull out money. You ignore the fact that these loans they refuse to pay back are for homes that don't exist. Isn't that a very important distinction from what we've seen in the past?"
"Yeah buddy it‚Äôs gonna collapse, the biggest economic factor is always expectations."
"Smart videos : Speaking calmly, analysing deeply situations and saying facts

Clickbate videos : ""CHINA WILL DIE IN 27 DAYS!!! WILL IT BE THE END OF CHINA!? SEE CHINA HAS A BIG DEPT!"""
"China's economy is not collapsing at this time but they will at some point in the future. They are experiencing extremely rapid population aging due to the fact that the average Chinese woman has barely over one child during her life time - and that is in a society which due to sex-selective abortion already has a massive excess of men, so translated to a population-wide birth rate this is even lower than what we have seen in some European countries which had similar birth rates at some point (Spain for example). Political and economic power is downstream from demographics and there is nothing which can be done about that."
The Chinese money has a very long arm rooted in people you would never believe would reach

"Yes, sure. Learned from the US housing crisis by creating... an even bigger bubble! ü§£
Of course the Youtubers have to exaggerate to get views, duh! That being said, there will be a collapse in the next months to years, because of the big size. But as usual, it will be only for the poor and middle class. And the countryside rather than the big cities. They are 2 different worlds."
How many Yuan did you get for this? :P
"The fundamental problem with China today, as well as with the US before the Great Depression, before the Great Recession and with Japan in the early 1990's is:
""How do you manage a huge bubble that is about to burst?"".
It seems that despite many economists' warning against inflating such a bubble in the first place, the politicians are too tempted to do it.
The solutions that have been tested so far fall into 3 groups + 1 additional, ""theoretical"" type that, as far as I know, hasn't been tested yet:

1. Let the bubble burst and let the economy find a new balance. This was to some extend done in the 1930's in the US. To some extend, because after letting the bubble burst there was a huge amount of protective legislature (The New Deal) that, according to some economists, made the recovery slower than it would have been otherwise. Proof of that idea? Previous recessions like the one in 1920, with a strong recession and a swift recovery. Actually bank runs and banking sector collapses were quite common prior to the 1930's - that's why probably the banks were allowed to fail also at the start of the Great Depression. The slow recovery from the Great Depression made everyone weary of letting the banks collapse again. The banking sector became more and more centralized. As a result the second type of solution emerged:

2. ""Just keep it as it is"". This is the Japanese-style solution. From the 1990's onward the Japanese economy is burdened by huge amounts of debt, with very little growth, further pulled down by a rapidly aging society. I also think that this is the most likely scenario for China, just on a much larger scale. More on that below.

3. The third group of solutions is ""pump more bubbles"". This happened in the US after 2008. The real-estate and stock bubble has burst, but it was followed immediately by a commodities bubble, a gold bubble, again recovery in real estate prices and then by a crypto bubble. I might have missed some of the bubbles that were inflated during the last 14 years. Of course this is not a solution, and it can generate such imbalances that it will be unsustainable and will require a different solution (type 1, 2 or 4). It is unlikely for China to take this route. The Communist Party will probably find it too risky, plus there would have to be a lot of innovation in the financial sector (new types of contracts, securities, etc), and the CP will not like it, as it would mean less transparency and less control over the capital markets.

4. The fourth type of solution to the bubble problem is innovation.
A bubble is fueled by excessive lending (either directly to businesses via loans and bonds, or to investors, who use the leverage to buy stocks and other assets, like securitized mortgages, commodities, crypto-currencies, etc). Lending happens when people believe in the future prospects of their investments. People who own capital are more likely to lend it if they see good prospects of borrowers. The central bank and the banking system mediate in the lending process and kind of ""artificially"" lower the interest rate, thereby making the economy run as if the prospects of future returns were higher than people would actually assess them on their own. In part the ""aggregate"" nature of banking, where the central bank acts as a broker making sure that liquidity is in the system, is a type of ""universal insurance"" that really lowers the risk for individual lender. So by making banking centralized, the economy can offset the risk of many investment opportunities, thereby lowering the risk for the lender (the average person keeping their money in the bank).
If the bubble has grown on a type of ""false promises"", fueled by cheap loans, it could actually work out, i.e. not burst and grow more without casing economic imbalances, if the economy really became much more productive, i.e. if the previously wrongly assessed prospects suddenly became real. Imagine if there was a breakthrough in electricity storage, like a new, cheap, easily rechargable, high-energy-density battery. This would definitely be a huge productivity push. Or if self-driving commercial vehicles were ready to be deployed on a large scale, etc. etc. It would of course mean that crypto, real estate and a especially oil investors would make a loss, but they would quickly switch to the new hot stocks and asset classes and on the scale of the economy their losses would be offset by gains of others. Hopefully this will be the solution to current imbalances in the US and Europe.

Going back to China today vs Japan in 1990's comparison. They have a huge debt burden and an ageing society, but the political system is different, and the Chinese society is still much poorer today than Japanese society was in the 1990's. Japan is a democracy and its government gains legitimacy in general elections. Stagnant economy that Japan has had since the 1990's does not bother people that much, because they have a high standard of living. On the other hand China is a dictatorship and for the last 30 years its government got its legitimacy at least partly from high economic growth. Its society is still relatively poor. In case China follows the Japanese scenario, the question is: will the Chinese society calmly accept stagnation and poor living standards in the next 10 or 20 years? The Chinese government would have to either crack down on social discontent (very likely, actually already happening) much more than it was necessary in the past (as there was much less discontent), or gain a new source of legitimacy. This source could be either some form of democratic reforms (very unlikely) or a military conflict (relatively likely)."
"When those jokers (actually I think & believe there is only one or a few of them using different names & accounts) started the twisted stories of China's economy is going to tank within 34 days, I marked their words & would be counting the days. The first story came out on 8/8/22. That means by 11th of Sept 2022 and if China is still doesn't crashed, I want to see how / where those jokers are going to hide their faces! Today is already 28th of Aug. Another 2 more weeks to go. So let's us count the days till 11/9/2022."
Guy probably payed by China
"Exactly.  Sensationalist and alarmist drivel on other channels.  I block them all.  Yes China faces some economic challenges (as most countries do), but ""collapse"", ""bankrupt"", ""devastation""... give me a break."
100 percent it will fail if current leader stays in power.
"No, but it will be the beginning of the collapse. It will collapse, it just takes a long time, probably 10 years. By 2030, many international companies will have finished moving their factories away from China to Vietnam and India."
"Lots of factors he is missing:
1) China's real-estate market is 30% of their economy and is bankrupt, defaulting on it's loans, and in no way can hope to repay those debts because they were based on a Ponzi scheme, which is designed to funnel as much money as possible to the owner right before it deliberately collapses. Even if there was no intent to deliberately steal from their investors, such a scheme can only work if something, like a worldwide pandemic, doesn't throw a wrench in the system. Most of China's economy is based on similar get-rich-quick schemes that pay off well in the short-term if you can survive, but with inexperienced and greedy investors and politicians at the helm often leads to disaster, just like the USA with their pension system.
2) The Chinese banking system, which is mostly state owned, is as propped up on bad loans just like the Lehman Brothers, only they got the funds to pay for those loans by borrowing money over and above their bottom line holdings, which also included not just real estate schemes, but projects like the Belt-Road trade route which has failed due to wars and economic depressions in several key countries supporting the project. $1.2 trillion is a lot of money to lose on a trade deal like that with no hope of ever getting their money back. The banks are bankrupt, they just won't admit it.
3) Chinese politicians control who the banks can invest in, so they often pick politically-motivated projects to invest in regardless of the risk involved. For example: After the Great Recession, they invested heavily in high-speed trains, which were astronomically more expensive than traditional trains, and built the trains in places that didn't need them for political reasons. Most of those trains are running at an operating loss. To make matters worse, these trains were mostly passenger trains, not freight trains, so when the money went to the high-speed railways, their freight lines went into disrepair and are quickly becoming dilapidated due to a lack of funds; funds which are currently unavailable due to economic problems.
4) Gold is being manipulated by central banks throughout the world, dollars are a fiction now, and crypto is non-existent with nothing to back it. The gold bubble will break and those who have physical gold will get rich, but crypto will crash and dollars will be in a world of trouble before long if we don't stop printing them like carnival tickets.
5) Rescuing the banking system by printing more money will only inflate their currency to the point where the Yuan will become worth less than the paper it was printed on, which it pretty much is.

Given these factors, in my opinion, China no longer has the basis of wealth, effective leadership, or internal stability to repair their damaged economy which came about from years of bad investments, fraud, parasitic trade policies, and ineffective leadership.

The world is a house of cards, all debts must be paid, and the bill comes due. China's bill has been served, and with no cash on hand and a credit rating in the sewer, they're quickly running out of options."
"How many CCP supporters, PLAnand Wumao commenting on this video? 
There a multiple mass protests in China relate to banking and housing. Those news are suppressed. Their economy should already crash if there are no censorship."
"Chinas society will collapse. Diseases, illnesses from the unhealthy life and poisoned air and water will do their job more than any measly economic crisis."
"What if the issue is not an inflationary collapse but a deflationary collapse? Given they are export driven and a large US trading partner, they more or less a dollarized economy. I think a better comparison is to Japan"
"One flaw in your thesis is the misapprehension that the US economy was rescued in 2008. It was... sort of... but in a way that turned was an economic downturn into what we are seeing now: The potential complete dissolution of US society potentially leading to the fall of the petrodollar and the pax Americana.

In a way, the years leading up to 2020 were the ultimate dead cat bounce.

China trying to spend its way out of trouble forcefully breaks one of the central processes of healthy economies, which is that of creative destruction. They may not collapse in 35 days, or even 356 days. But the basic logic of China's meteoric rise has been broken now.

The basic logic of the US-China economic cooperation dating back to the 70s is basically being severed. The result will be at least as consequential as the great Depression, at least."

"your video is short-sighted, it's not even funny. it's a FAR longer-term problem in that country than anywhere else in the world. their collapse isn't just about the banking crisis. the company has no viable infrastructure. it's 100% built on ""face"", and it's crumbling before out eyes. international corporations are fleeing in droves due to poor policy (and sanctions). the world doesn't ""need chinese products"". the world just needs cheap products, and they can be produced in the entire southern hemisphere, and asia. china is not a cost effective solution for corporations anymore compared to India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Mexico, etc. The world is moving away from china very quickly, and their growth to superpower status is not going to continue at all. it doesn't pay"
"I agree that click-baity titles are annoying, but this video is not much better. It offers a very basic and surface level analysis of the situation and a weak argument for why there wouldn‚Äôt be a collapse, when compared to the certain declaration of the title. So China can avoid a collapse by printing money, however how do they avoid a collapse of their currency if they print what is needed to counter the collapse of their massive real estate sector. The whole reason for the three red lines policy was to pop the bubble and reduce moral hazard. I think this video is making a massive assumption that the Chinese government will back down and that if they do, their response to save the economy itself won‚Äôt cause a collapse in confidence in the Chinese economy and currency. When leverage gets high enough it‚Äôs not enough to say that just printing money will be enough. In 2008 it was in the US and maybe China will succeed in kicking the can down the road, or some kind of a slow-burning decline, but one way or the other some point all the bubbles will have to deflate, including the one in China and the bubbles in the US and other countries as the 2008 can was only kicked forward by the QE. Unfortunately when the can is kicked forward, the next kick required will be even bigger and eventually you can‚Äôt kick hard enough any more."

"The main differences between China and US are exact similarities with USSR (which is gone - have you heard about that). According to your train of thoughts USSR shouldn't collapse, but that is a fact. China is a coumunist state - one man show and never learning lessons. In your ""analysis"" you missed more problems - energy mismanagement, health care mismanagement,  how about food management (or lack of), infrastructure fiasco, you probably are not aware of the corruption. Regional finances mismanagement (which led to property collapse). They've screwed up the climate and environment and the goods are no more cheaper (the whole point of iconomic boom).One child policy is not even the worse one - they are containing and isolated smart people and indipendent people with opinions. You also wrongly assume that Russia won't collapse, but we are getting there. You know nothing about the social unrest right now and military ambitions (with the same crappy army as Russian's) which will lead to further isolation and punishment of China. China's ""Berlin wall"" hasn't collapsed yet, but is about a time."
"Finance YouTubers: clickbait is king!

"No economy in history has ever been in the situation China is in now. They have practically all foreign investment pulling out, they'll have absolutely all new foreign investment stopped dead, they're losing manufacturing at a massive rate. And there's three sources of wealth. There's mining, manufacturing and agriculture. That's it. Everything else draws from those three so when one is declining rapidly, the property sector is in free fall and banks are failing, that's absolutely a recipe for disaster. The CCP is going to prop up their economy by pumping cash into it but how long can that last? China is in big trouble."
soooooo how much did the ccp pay you to make this video?
"Hahaha yeah no, it wont collapse, it has already collapsed.

China is a house of cards. Stagnation with slow decline like Japan simply doesnt work for China. They rely on foreign money pumping in their economy, they rely on economic growth for social stability"
Thank god for Joeri!
China is about to collapse: says every click bait video on YouTube.
"Not even three minutes in and...
You see, the ""bank runs"" in China are limited to a tiny number of private rural banks, and were not connected to any sort of economic collapse, but to scammers. Which are now being prosecuted, and the bailouts of people who lost their savings are already happening. There is no analogy to the other examples of bank runs, whatsoever. There are no bank runs affecting to actually systemically important, state run banks."
Guess we shall see won't we.
Yer I think you are right;and it is to no ones interest for China's economy to collapse
I love how he is calling out 2 youtubers directly lmao
Interesting analysis
"China's economy wont collapse in a western way. In a sense, chinese economy is already in a state of depression and recession."
Thanks for this great video!

Gonna be funny when it does collapse
Continue the excellent unbiased content.
"I felt this whole CHINA IS COLLAPSING trend on Youtube was fishy when I noticed none of the mainstream media talking about it. Seeing how thirsty the mainstream media is about bashing China, and how they refuse to talk about this CHINA ECONOMIC COLLAPSE made me question the reality of this situation. Yes, China has a lot of problems now, the bank and housing crisis, the drought crisis etc etc but none of the mainstream outlets ever mentioned  Depression or Economic Collapse in the past few weeks."
"Chaynah's economy must collapse in 23-28 days for clicks!
:D"
can you do climate change
"That's the exact reason why I don't trust any financial YouTuber. Most make their money from the referalls they get to sign up x financial app, the most they know about finance is the basics and how to get people to sign up using referall links.. and then they use their clickbait thumbnails and titles to top it off acting like they know what they're talking about."
"You're correct partially.    The economy will recover at some point.    The real risk is societal.   China is in a very severe drought.   Water for crops, drinking, and hydro energy are at risk  A society that is water scarce will not be stable for years to come."
YouTube idiots want views
"The whole world is collapsing, dumdums."
"Are you telling me that a rich country, with over educated population and great geopolitical connexions is in a good position for the future?!?!
Hum... ü§î"
"I've been following chinas economic troubles for a long time and i really appreciate that properly critical videos like this are starting to pop up, but this is probably your most clickbaity video yet and I can't say I like that direction."
"Yes but the clickbait gets those YouTubers a lot of money, which is why they did the videos in the first place."
"It doesn't matter. As a Chinese, I've been listening to your guys talk about the collapse of China for twenty years."
How likely is foreign companies moving their factories out of China? It seems like there isn‚Äôt much incentive to produce in China unless it‚Äôs consumed locally.
The China bots are up in Arms up voting this video  hahaha
"I find it hard to believe the Chinese government doing all they are doing on real estate, tech and other industry without preparing for the fallout. Especially they are doing it on their terms and their timeline. So, I am optimistic about their future growth."
"Agree about clickbaitey nature of other channels. But this author didn't take any of the following into account: China's highly authoritarian CCP, extreme corruption at every level, total lack of institutions and finally the upcoming demographic collapse. So comparing China and Japan is totally misplaced."
China's economy will not collapse as per West's propaganda or whims and wishes !!!
"Yeah, I had serious doubt when I saw all those other videos, especially the time frame, why did the stock market not fall if this was the case, did every investor want to lose all their money?"
At last someone with real common sense. Great video mate
Sometimes the richest man has to act poor for his own safety.
The world has a chance to get rid of a communist government the largest one on the planet and what are we doing we‚Äôre feeding it helping it survive totally stupid!
China won‚Äôt collapse it has it‚Äôs illegal drug trade Crystal meth and fentanyl to fall back on. Not to mention the world falling all over itself to buy Chinese solar panels and win generators. Communism in China it‚Äôs going to be there forever because we are still financing it!!! üò°üëé if we were smart we would let it die so that the great dragon could stand up finally free of communism
great video. I think your scenario is spot on given the current situation. glad to see you are getting sponsors instead of asking viewers for money. I think it's a better business model in your space
"Hmm. Looks highly sus. Check him for a CCP membership card and BRI loans, boys. üòâ"
"3rd. You're missing one vital part, the China Federal party, taking over CCP"
I still believe the Fed tried everything it could to save Lehman and in the end was unable to.
Everything's okay no worries be the guy on the beach looking at the tidal wave üåä
China's economy will not collapse but its citizens will.
China is running out of young people.  Period.  Your model doesn't matter if you have no people.  China is going to fail and by 2050 there will be half as many Chinese people as there are now.  That is fact that cannot be undone.
"The thing you miss is that China bankers appear to be doing the same thing US bankers did after the bailout.  Even though they have money to lend, they don't seem to be lending it, because of what horrible risks the property companies are.   This isn't going to end well for a china, and I don't see much reason they won't go through a great recession.   I don't think this is a problem Centralized Planning will fix without making even worse market distortions.  All China can do is kick the can down the road to a future date."

thanks for the info and different perspective! +sub
You did the best analysis üßê not does idiots
"Anyone with a sufficient brain cell would know that these ""The Chinese economy will collapse in *insert number*"" is outright dumb ad stupid.

I have seen people compare this to how the Soviet Union collapsed, without taking into account of the social and political situation, as well as the economic problems.

China is not Sri Lanka. China is not the Soviet Union. And it is certainly not like the United States. 

If anything, the Chinese government have learnt from the financial and political problems which happened in these countries so that it won't bring about their own end. 

Of course, that's not to say that the Chinese government is the best or is invincible. But they're not dumb, and they are not going to collapse because some YouTubers made some analysis and came to the conclusion that it would happen.

One thing I do believe is likely to happen is a stagnation of the Chinese economy. The Chinese government can try to prevent this, but that's not certain to succeed - though it is not impossible. 

Even one of these YouTubers whom I followed deliberately put a thumbnail that said ""Chinese economy will collapse in 3 days"", only to reveal that it won't really happen and many of these YouTubers are just bullshiting themselves."
It seems China has been collapsing since 2000
"We all agree, productive wealth is gold, money, power. But the issue is markets. China (like everyone else) must have them. And, there, Washington  holds the balance."
"The Great Depression was a monetary failure, not a financial failure the bank that started it all had a positive balance, and its bankruptcy ended up with a big payout to its owners, when the bankrupcy case ended in courts. The Great Recession was both a financial and a monetary failure, but both were caused by bad government policies."
"I am so glad you did this video. Some of those videos I have seen are so sensationalist. I totally can understand people talking about the issues in Chinese economy but those videos literally look like propaganda pieces.

There are serious problems. The outcome who knows. But I like your analysis and why they may be able to get through the fragilities better than the total armageddon"
"I know look at all the dumb videos on yourtube about China last month they were saying the 3 gorges dam was going to collapse too much rain, now they are in a drought no one has water MAKE UP OUR MINDS! anyway what purpose do these videos serve? are you hoping Chinese citizens are watching?"
"The capacity of the Chinese to suffer and to put up with criminal and incompetent government is unparalleled.  The Great Famine, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the Zero Covid policy -- all without a peep from the people.  No one will stand up to the repressive power of the Party or dare to stand alone.  The Tank Man was one of the few.  Look what happened to him.  The difference this time is that more and more Chinese have an out via migration.  Expect to see it skyrocket. It will occur -- is already occurring -- top-down."
What about China's rivals waging economic warfare to crash the Chinese economy to attack its military?
A.G.I Will be man's last invention.
Better and more honest analysis so far.
"I do like your theories but I'm still watching what the public does in response to the mortgages. They seem pretty riled up and CCP is facing a loss of public faith that could put its efforts for recovering relatively safely at risk. Xi does in fact value stability but if the CCP loses public confidence it could lead to a full-blown collapse. Highly unlikely I know, but possible. These days though....you just never know the kind of crazy stuff that could happen. It bares watching very closely."
"Something interesting about the ""China is dying"" youtube videos is that they usually claim that:
1. Youtube is trying to censor them so they need your money so that they can keep bringing you ""da truf"".
2. Chinese bots keep reporting their videos so don't be surprised if the video is down shortly.
3. Chinese bots keep adding nonsense comments like ""this is objectively false"" so don't listen to them."
great video man. i think that of you change your microphone your Channel Will get a big Spike in subscription. keep going!
"it's important to define precisely what we mean with ""collapse"". without doing so, it's unclear for example whether the US economy ""collapsed"" in 2008 - most basic products and services kept being produced, there was just a lot of financial chaos, unemployment and uncertainty. The biggest impact was an ideological one: it took a bailout of some of the largest financial institutions to keep the system going, meaning that from that point forward no one could seriously claim the US has an unbridled ""free market"" economy any more. Something very similar will probably happen in China, with the CCP doing what needs to be done to keep the system running, but the illusion that capitalism in China is functioning in some sense independent from the CCP's finegrained control will be further dispelled than it ever already was. And in the longer run that is going to put a massive damper on economic growth."
"Great video, but please buy a better microphone."
I think it is more like ‚Äúmiddle income trap‚Äù than complete collapse. And China can always fall back on planned economy with coercion. It can literally enslave the whole population to work even when there is no money to pay for salary. Your are welcome.
It will happen. Just going to take time. It will come.
"Nice and rational. A good explanation on what might actually happens and why, what I'm actually curious about. What could happen that would have a non-controllable situation for China?

Secondly, if you hit double 6,5,4,3,2 or 1 are Al 1/36 (this is how I interpreted the dice explanation), though I think you mean either a double 6 or a either a double 5,4 or 3? ( Sorry non-native ) but good videoüòÅ"
Of course China economy will not collapse. What an idiot remarks.
"What is certain is that the American and European economies, which collapsed first, went bankrupt before the Chinese economy collapsed"
"i mean its sure looking like its doing that now ; plus their population will halve in 3 to 4 decades.... I don't think there's any way it survives demographic collapse but ok, the current iteration of the chinese system is not even 100 years old idk why people think its invincible unless they believe CCP propaganda about thousands of years of stability and communism"
Finally someone said it.
"Even it really collaps, the authorities will state that the trend is only transitory.ü§£"
Anytime someone says something on the internet with extreme certainty I just don‚Äôt believe them anymore
Honestly EU collapse seems more visible
"I've been blocking those channels.  There are big problems in China and the standard of living in China for the majority is likely to go into reverse.  The growth model in China is broken, the property market is broken, and their demographics are broken...but there is no imminent collapse.  However, I now think could take a long time for China to have the world's biggest economy, and it no longer seems anything like certain.  The views in this video make a lot of sense IMHO.  it will be interesting to see how the incredibly extreme controls implemented by the CCP actually work in this scenario, keeping in mind the Chinese economy has flourished with cheap labour, electricity, las environmental controls and western countries being willing to become reliant on China.  All of these things are at least partially reversing."
China is way more responsive than the USA when it comes to controlling the economy. It just makes me laugh all these YouTubers claiming china is on the brink of collapsing!
"Of course it wouldn‚Äôt collapse. Simply because it is all state owned and the CCP dictates reality. So the numbers from China are whatever the CCP says they are. No one gets to question the official statistics, or even audit anything, unless the CCP wants it audited‚Ä¶Though I wonder how china would fare against global sanctions if they decided to attack the country of Taiwan‚Ä¶fudging the numbers won‚Äôt do the trick at that point I believe‚Ä¶"
chlna its econemy has allready collapsed the only difference is the communist leaders will never admit to the world that its econemy has collapsed and that its army navy and airforce is not combat ready the only arguement they understand is that when they  attack taiwan their army navy and airforce should be all sent back to china in body bags eventually china will make the same mistake that russia made after all china and russia are all little communists showing poor leadership
"Man Chinese aren't stupid or blind, Economy starts to go down they will just start a war, like Americans have done many times since the end of WWII"
"A Japan like stagnation and slow decline would be terrible for China and I think that's what people mean when they say ""collapse"" of Chinese economy."
The exact Same Videos I watched...
"The biggest problem I'm not seeing addressed with your presentation is that instead of Banks being punished it's the people.  They are not doing any form of debt forgiveness or public bailout for the people who ended up dealing with the corporations and banks that acted in bad faith. Homeowners have stopped paying mortgages on houses that still aren't completed and in some cases are being demolished.

That doesn't even touch the electricity problems the lower half of their nation is facing at the moment to further exacerbate the national problems."
US has a higher chance of collapse than China.
The CCP can‚Äôt control the response of its people their revolt will bring down the economy
"I mean they have $3.3 trillion dollar in their hand, I don't see how can China collapse. Though I think in long term, low working population will create some hindrance"
This guy knows nothing about business
üëç
"If China can't feed itself because of massive droughts how can it not go into recession? Taiwan will not sink China nor will diminished trade with the west as long as they have Russia, China, much of Africa and Latin America to trade with. However the Yangtze drying up will be problematic."
"This guy makes the, ""China will be alright video"" and the shills come out of the woodwork. üòÜ it would be a great day for the world for the world's current nazis to go down. But the sad reality is the people of that country have to topple it. Some economic woe, even as bad as the Great depression, wont make the ccp collapse if it's citizens do nothing and accept the suicide nets and lack of freedom"
"Not as slow as Britain‚Äôs. Figures just released by dept of statistics, say Britains GDP is lowest in 300 years"

"Sheesh! I have been prepped over China‚Äôs collapse since Gordon Chang's assertion 20 years ago. BTW Gordon's still on the talk show circuit yelping about China's fall. Can China decide faster whether it wants to fall or not.
The suspense is killing me!"

"A small bunch of not good people are keeping the whole planet from living! So let's unite and change everything and everyone on the planet will live happily!!!! Friends, the International Social Project CREATIVE SOCIETY is gaining tremendous momentum in the world.

"As Mr Krabs would say: money,money,money,money."
"Well I think major social uproar and turmoil happening in China as we speak might be an indication...That should not be underestimated cause in a regime like china's, protests are very risky for individuals , and can even be life threatening. The fact that there is so much protest regardless can give you an idea of the despair of the people. So while there might not be total collapse economy-wise , the consequences will be quite severe for China."
its the west that is going down. (i dont like china or their policies..)
I notice all the detractors of China give examples of what is wrong and why it will collapse without noticing that those same examples apply to their own countries
"It is collapsing though, especially with the massive drought's that have led to the country running out of water."
"liked the video! but you used the wrong map for china,  there should be taiwan in china's map! hope u can fix dat"
"Yeah!! I have listened to ALL of the guys you listed!! It‚Äôs like ALL of those influencer clickbaiters have forgotten that China is a dictatorship that has tons of investments in other countries, including a huge amount in the USA. China can adversely impact the US with a sell off of their bond, treasury, and real estate holdings. Plus, so much comes out of China and they can force whatever changes they need internally, and they continue to utilize slave labor. There‚Äôs no way China‚Äôs economy will collapse."
America is built  underground  in china . Yes  america .not china..
"Most of the commentators who support these doomsayers of Chinas economy are people who just want to believe that it is collapsing so will believe anything. Same with Russia, but they seen to know everything detrimental to Russia but have never been there. My nephew is married to a Russian and says things are tough but alright"
"You sound like the RE bubble & Economy of China is very stable... No sorry, I don't buy your opinion!!!"
The farking bit of Wion is talking tru her shit hole.
"No way China will collapse, lol. Their new generation doesn't have the grit to rebel. As most people value stability and growth, rather than personal rights that isn't even guaranteed under a new regime."
"rolling double 5, 4, or 3 has EXACTLY THE SAME probability as rolling double 6"
Big thumbs up on that cool blooded analysis. Excellent approach and much more to the point than this sensationalistic stuff you see everywhere. Keep it coming :)
"You make some interesting points however China is in a huge amount of national debt, the state run railway industry is over $1 Trillion in debt, the propping up of the financial sector is at some point going to have to be paid for. In 2019 the Chinese Debt to GDP ratio sat somewhere around 250-270% and that was before COVID, if China does survive this real estate crisis the problem with the countries debt is going to cripple the economy in the coming decade"
how much are you earning from the cpp
Subscribed -- too many China hate trains and fear mongering going on as it is in Western mainstream media. Dont wanna see it on click baity youtube channels.
True! Big check! Correct! Right! Excactly 100 %

The more you print the higher inflation is and the populations suffers causing a chain reaction all the way down to the people spending. So how do you think china‚Äôs economy is going to come through. This is a dog eat dog time.

"Xi is aiming to go for another term this year, you seriously think he will let the economy crash on the year he is seeking to stay on in power?"
"If those clowns knew anything about economics, they'd be making money on the market or getting their 2/20 from managing funds instead of making YouTube videos."

"everythings that goes up must come down, china economy will come down eventually"
Not collapsing yet.    Many young Chinese are looking for ways to get out of the country.   Which I find interesting because not long ago they were so pro CCP.
"Don't believe the hype, it's a sequel ...this is all wishful thinking and propaganda by US - prepare for war, decoupling and New world order"
"If i had a dollar for every smug and dumb as a rock, fake ass economic expert youtuber that predicted Chinas fall on youtube, I would be rich as fk lol."
"According to the Chinese on Weibo paint a different picture,in fact chinese business owners are now laying down, Chinese banks are refusing to let people remove money, zero covid policy ruined the economy. So according to the Chinese themselves the nation is on a downward slide. So one must wonder are you in the CCP's pocket?"
4:12 - where is that view from?
Can you do a video on Sri Lanka and other troubled countries?
"I have a few problems with the commentator's position. Who said China's situation is anything like the 'great depression' or 'great recession'? You have a situation in China that is more akin to Japan's stagflation of the 1990's - otherwise known as 'the lost decade'. This is  called the 'Japanification' of an economy where a country cannot escape a period of stagnation, defined by weak growth due to excessive saving and weak consumption, ultra-loose monetary policy and deflationary pressures. Deflation can cause citizens to stop spending in the expectation that prices will fall lower in the future and can also hurt employers if wages do not fall with prices. This increases the pressure on the economy and can cause a vicious cycle. So whilst the commentator may be technically correct by saying that China is not suffering the US styled 'great depression', 'great recession' or economic collapse like the Sri Lankan economy  it does not mean China is not going through it's own major economic problems i.e. the 'Japanification' of the Chinese economy [1].  

One could be mistaken to believe the commentator is trying to do a magical trick where they offer up scenarios of what China's economy is not whilst not coherently explaining  what the Chinese economy is currently suffering -  the 'Japanification' of it's economy. I am sure the commentator is not attempting to avoid talking about China's economic reality so the commentator really need's to clarify their position better. 

Furthermore, unlike Japan China will not go on to become an advanced economy - it is called the 'middle income trap'. Why doesn't the commentator do a video on that? 

Finally, China's strict outflow controls have a lot of negatives. For example, they complicate the repatriation of profits for foreign investors. Ironically, this can negatively affect flows into the country. Moreover, Chinese investors‚Äô limited investment options result in capital pooling in certain sectors, causing bubbles to form. When restricted from access to foreign markets, investors will look for high returns within the country. The likelihood of this capital finding its way into the already overheated real estate market or other bubbles is high [2]. The reference I provided for this point is from 2017 where it acts as a cautious prophecy to what China is suffering right now - an inflated housing bubble and subsequent continuing collapse of China's housing market.

"Great video, excellent counter point to all the collapse videos. Your points about about massive dollar holdings and ability to print money really struck home. Besides all that you are an excellent speaker. Will sub and watch more."
"The tech ""crackdown"" is about re-balancing the economy.... for the past few years, much capital and top graduates have gone to the big tech firms - Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Kuaishou etc. Beijing wants capital and top talent go towards advance manufacturing and other high tech like aerospace, pharma, shipbuilding, 3rd gen nuclear, 6G, AI and quantum tech.   This is the reason for the tech (internet) crackdown."
"Again... Easier to Macro BS than to Micro BS
Of course, their situation won't be like USA or Sri Lanka. That argument can be used to ALL countries.
Specifically not talking about the main concerns of the issue. (Real Estate, Debt boycotts, Lockdowns, and Environmental hazards) Sure, giving a date to a ""collapse"" is BS, but misdirecting the topic doesn't make your opinion less BS compared to them"
Thank you. This China click bait has been utterly perplexing and infuriating to watch. Clearly these idiots have NEVER experienced China first hand.
"You failed to mention one of the huge issues with the real estate crisis in China: local governments are not funded by taxes, they are funded by real estate long term 100 year leases to developers. If local governments run out of money, it would have severe economic effects. If the national government steps in there and all the other places, they could start to run low and inflation could start ramping up."
"According to the likes of Gordan Chang and other ""experts"", China has been collapsing for over 20 years, in fact China has been collapsing into the world's 2nd largest economy (real GDP) and world's largest economy (PPP GDP) and world's largest trading nation."
"At 10:10 Although not a big deal the double dice analogy is mathematically inaccurate. Rolling a double six is equally as likely as rolling double 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1.
Maybe he should have said that rolling a combination of ""7"" is more likely than a ""12""...
Sorry for nerding."
Would issuing huge bailouts not cause rampant inflation and therefore further instability?
"This is my first time watching your video, and seems to be the last. Quite a lot of BS because you have ""my opinion"" which do not relate to facts enough, as many of those other youtubers you are blaming. You intentionally, or because you just don't know, forget several important facts
- peoples savings are mostly (70%) at real estates and those ghost cities are loosing their value very fast. What government can do? Nothing... order bulldozers? 
- banks in China has had not such control as in USA and Europe so banks has just wasted peoples moneys for example saving account money has been used to risky investments and those moneys has been lost. China has stopped riots by force and made peoples moving difficult (zero covid policy QR-code changed to red without health reasons)
- China's local governments has get fundings by land lease (70 years) but has used those moneys normally during 2.3 years. They don't have enough incomes and central government needs to rescue. The local governments has set up companies for finance expenses, to get loans from banks and those are now in big problems
- manufacturing is going slowly away from China. They will be long time important in manufacturing but it is moving away. 1) to cheaper countries 2) local production because avoid problems when crisis (covid-19 experience) 3) political reasons, spying (spy chips and stealing IP). China is manufacturing now more products which are having higher value so it helps but still not so sunny as you told
- because of political reasons many investors do not want to invest any more so much to China. One of those is worlds biggest investor, Norwegian state investment fund which is having ethical codes for their investments. For example they got money to start invest from oil but now they don't invest to oil companies. Political risk in China is all the time rising
- many of China's state companies are having huge financial problems (for example China high speed trains are making losses more than 1000 Billion). Many of those huge projects are having problems because those were made for showing how great China is and they didn't made proper financial calculations. You perhaps have money to build big wide road but you need lots of money every year to keep it running

Because China is dictatorship, it can hide and control situation at different way than western countries but China will have big problems and one big problem you didn't know at all is corruption. It means that money has been used totally different way than meant and the official figures, official data and bookkeeping are not showing truth. That way you can hide facts some time until reality (run out of money) hits the fan."
"Idk. It just seems that the sheer scale of China's problems are much larger than the US pre-2008. And housing is much more core to their economy than it is to us. Like its the go-to investment whereas here, stocks and stuff are also an option b/c the government isn't gonna seize it on a dime. I saw one report that they have enough empty houses for 90 million people. The US never had ghost cities like that. Additionally, China has a history of cooking the books - so much of its economic figures can't be trusted making it murky to gauge. I definitely agree that their government is likely to handle it better than ours.  Idk I guess I want to see more explored in this analysis here."
Shill accounts and paid off westerners are easy to spot. I'm glad China will collapse and also glad they'll take down the world with them.
"The fear porn channels often neglect manufacturing capacity and food production when they make their evaluations. It's just like certain Nobel Prize economists try to predict world affairs with ""ideal models"" that only look at certain stats.

Now to be fair, stephen graham and other folks make collapse videos on every major country. Wonder how they react to their own videos from the past LOL"
"China is Bankrupt but you Fake paid Supporters don't want to Show ?

There is No education system in poor and lower middle Scale which is large ,
Looted most from nature ,natural resources are ended ,
They are now producing third class products & 
Mostly around 1/5 th of population died in Covid-19 waves , So many technicians died too ,
China is Crawling on Ground 
Corruption is at it's peak & Real estate developers are looting with Government executives ,

How much are you paid #Admin ?"
China Central bank just send police to beat people who wants money from banks...
"Great video, but i do have some pointers, id like to add:
Right now, china is simutaniusly facing the worst drought and flood in the countries modern history, reducings its energy security, and basically stopping produktion in several states, as well as ruining the crop yields.
Also a unmotivated workforce and a now large unemployment making it worse. Most people have been fed up of the cencorship and curropt√¨on

As they are saying, they traded freedom for security and prosperity, and now they have nothing"
"It seems to me that Xi's ""Social Stability"" model needs to be modified. he is actually promoting ""Social stability through the superior Communist model."" Close inspection will show that he is destroying his economy so that all economic forces come under control of the government. It seems to me that within months millions of Chinese will starve to death."
"But I like the funny faces Sorelle makes in her thumbnails for her 28 days and new 2 days videos, so you're probably wrong üòÅ.  Have you seen Peter Zeihan's doomer take?  His thesis is that the US is pulling back from globalization due to the end of the cold war, the US Navy is the only plausible guarantor of safe maritime  passage, and China is also undergoing a hard demographic collapse due to rapid urbanization.  He says that China may actually de civilize and see famines over the next couple decades.  I'm a bit skeptical, but he's not your average clickbaiter, search his name, he's given dozens of 1 hour ish talks on YT making the rounds for his new book.  Be curious to hear an economists take.
Edit: finish comment after hitting send accidentally."
What about the demographic collapse after 35 years of One Child policy?  We were initially told China's population would shrink 50% by 2100 but the 2020 census data (trickling out slowly because it's so bad) shows the previous census was exaggerated by regional authorities (to boost funding presumably) and China's population will actually drop by 50% by 2060.  That makes China the fastest aging country in the world.  Won't that be a problem?
finally...someone with sense!
"5:10 I don't get it, we have lending out of control leading to spending and prices (basically inflation) going out of control so people want their savings out of the banks, how does decreasing the interest rates help? Shouldn't they increase it as EU and US do instead?"
"Like governor said,China will never have crisis due to Chinese could eat grass for living well."
those youtubers might be paid by the US state department.
"Life goes on, China is still growing, while western countries are in decline....it's simple....and won't change"
"Fundamentally, the issue is china's strengths are 'perfectly countered' by the crises hitting China right now. China's central government *could probably* deal with the collapse of their housing bubble, *if* it has the trust of the populace, but it doesn't. It *could* leverage its industrial influence to prevent an inflationary death spiral, *if* it wasn't killing its industrial output with 0 COVID lockdowns. It *could* maintain its position as an industrial juggernaut, *if* it wasn't rapidly running out of young workers to shove into the factories to chew up. I think you bring up good points, but ignore the key 'x-factor' that is COVID taking a pickax to the one 'hinge' on which your argument rests."
Date and time of collapse... seriously...nearly as bad as Gold going to $ 10000
"How is it even possible to bring up the impending Chinese economic change without mentioning the Chinese citizens being beaten for trying to find answers from the banks who have taken their money and frozen their accounts and will not even open their doors to discuss how fucked those people are? This is very relevant, even from the most callous of perspectives, this will impact the overall economy."
"=NOPE AND YES AT THE SAME TIME.....IT ALL DEPENDS ON ABILITY TO PROJECT GLOBAL VIOLENCE WHICH IS THE REAL VALUE OF MONEY,AND IF THERE'S A FAKE ABILITY,THEN PRINTING MONEY WILL CAUSE HYPERINFLATION LIKE ZIMBABWE'S

.........BUT IS THE ABILITY IS ENOUGH,THIS WILL FILL UP THE GAUGE TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE OF CURRENCY,IT ALL DEPENDS"
I mean no it won't collapse but you know they want the clicks for views. But they just won't grow as fast as they used to. The steam is slowing down. But thanks for the info.
"Japan stagnated after already becoming one of the most developed economies on the globe. As a middle income authoritarian country, I'm not sure China can afford the same luxury"
"America wishes China would collapse, keep on dreaming."
I would describe it more like China was finally gliding down to earth than crashing.
Like how this guy didn't sell his soul for clickbait and is telling it straight.  Wish there were more people like this. I wish YouTube would reward you for your integrity.
"If China were to break up into warring states in the modern day, it would probably be the largest humanitarian disaster ever."
Could you create a video about Peter Zeihan‚Äôs China predictions?
"Great video, now do the impending worse-than-2008 housing and stock market crash"
Those channels counting days are just copying contents one another ü§£ü§£ü§£
"China and it's economy will collapse in the near future, simply due to demographics and deglobalisation. Many predict that this will happen within the next 10yrs, however, we are in different times now and other catalysts like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Covid and the knock on effect such as the multitude of problems starting to emerge in the supply chains. I must admit, I only got as far as watching the first 2mins of this video before commenting, because the urge to condradict the presenters premise just became to overwhelming ;-) I doubt he redeems himself in the as yet unwatched 80+% video, but I will do him the courtesy of watching the rest just in case. The collapse of the CCP and China's economy is almost a given from my perspective and the odds of this guy being correct ( sorry don't know presenter name as this is the 1st time I have viewed this channel ) are looking extremly slim to me, but I will persevere just in case he has had a lightbulb moment that has yet to dawn on the majority of expert opinion, which appears to me to overwhelmingly support the opposite viewpoint."
Last words muttered before collapse
nicely done.  good to have a non-conventional pov.
The other Youtubers is prepared to release their own definition of what the word collapse mean to them.  Good luck in this debate.  You can't win.
Yes china has most mony then any country
"What a bullshitter!
Bye.."
I call this bullshit makker. Lowering interest is a sign of weakness to try to avoid their literally collapsing housingmarket. Fluff up CCP some more.
"Thank God, somebody took the time to dissolve this democrats-paid ordered fudge. These ""China is collapsing in 2X days"" have been SO annoying."
Really good to hear a rational other perspective!
As long as they can keep producing they will remain one of the largest economies.  I think despite all the issues that is likely to continue.  The real danger is if the CCP fears loosing control and does something crazy like start a war in order to try and hold on.
We care so much about China's economy collapsing that we fail to see our own economy collapsing
"China has been collapsing since the early 2000 according to the media, every few year you will hear about a crisis in China that is going to collapse China in a month lol"

"The shrinking or collapse of Chinese RE industry was planned and executed by CCP or the govt, for the following reasons. 
 (1) The ballooning RE industry absorbed significant amount of finances, domestic and foreign, but the products can NOT be exported to earn foreign money. While paying interests to foreign banks is losing money, bad business.  (2) Housing was intended to let people live in, but millions of vacant units became speculative tools which do not supply housing for the poor or lower income population. (3) Collapse housing industry can transfer construction workers and materials to the national targeted industries. (4) The over leveraged banks took too much risks, but not too big to fall, let them fall to make a healthy banking sector.  Therefore, the three red line rules were announced in 2021 to cleanse the housing and banking  sectors, those trapped RE investors are just casualty of financial shake up.  üòé"
Modern Monetary theory is shit and there is a limit to how much money you can print.

"China's GDP, except for possibly a short blip, will continue to rise faster than ours indefinitely. Sorry folks."
"Videos about China collapsing (while resurging now) have been pretty common for years... with no visible collapse yet... and as of about seven months ago, Russia has also been ""going to collapse in the next 28 days"". It's a fascinating way to spot which channels to ignore permanently..."
"This tends to be something like what I was thinking. The US recover, like many other have recovered. But the demographic, real estate, corporate debt will be very interesting to see how they deal with it"
"China's Economy Collapse theory since early 2000s, but still have not become true."
These other youtubers bias against china that is why they exaggerate there contents to make china look bad. In my opinion that is the reason ‚úå
"We have been around for millenniums and will be around for many more. Thanks for the concerns from the arrogant West though. 
WE ARE THE MIDDLE KINGDOM! RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!"
"The true story is...those in the working class and below..ESPECIALLY the poor in China...will be the ones that are going through hell..

Water shortages. Cannot afford safe housing. Can't get safe food. Cannot afford health care. Cannot get their kids into upper education..and so on.

China gives easy college application exams to those from Beijing..while those from small or rural areas..Get IMPOSSIBLY HARD tests.

The CCP has learned that a communist government needs the SUPPORT AND ALLIANCE of the rich and elites...

So the poor can go through hell. And since China has no free press..We don't even learn the body counts of tragedies.

So the free trade system...China may be a part of it..but don't pay by the rules. Plus they know the entire world cannot allow China to collapse. So they have exploited it.

Wolf warrior diplomats...and China playing middle man because of their ridiculously favorable tax/tariffs



""THE CHINA SHOW.."" Podcast is a must watch!¬†@Rexplorer¬† I think it is explained well with..""China will sit on the shoulders of Giants..to shoot them in the head.""

Or even better...""China takes financial aid because it is a 'developing nation,' while also launching stuff to space...""

Def check out ""the China show,"" for a podcast by 'Serpentza,' and 'laowhy86,' who both had lived in China for over 10 years. So it has great China info..without all the clickbait..and without all the funded support/opposition. Just two dudes who loved living in China and adventuring...getting wives/kids etc...until the CCP barred its fangs and chased them and many others out. Def watch the most recent episodes over a few weeks. Crazy what ACTUALLY IS. NEWS...VS what news we get in the west about China =/

The CCP takes advantage of the idea of free trade..and they dont play by any rules..exploitation.

USA had the only navy after ww2. So USA bribed the world to back the USA against the USSR, in exchange for being able to trade.

That was not a thing..people had empires, colonies..and strong alliances..SO THEY COULD TRADE/for security.

USA is backing off that protection role..so that will likely cause different trade groups to rise up.

Like usa/canada/japan/Korea/mexico/ potentially other nations..

And then likely will see a group lead by whichever European country has the best geography and demographics.."
Make videos on Afghanistan's economy under the US sanctions because I have to listen that the Taliban has increased exports to double from the last years.
If it wasn't for us the Chinese bailing out the yanks in 2008 then they will still be scraping by today.
You forgot the Chinese bank money is fake money. It's all really backed by foreign currency. Almost like a Ponzi scheme. This is why they limit how much money ($50K) people get out of it.
"It's like saying North Korea will collapse lol, this isn't the west, the government will assert control. If people have to suffer they will suffer."
"Reasonable talk. But it is clear that your understanding of China is rather superficial. Do you know the age of retire is 60 for man and 55 for women ? The labour shortage could be a problem in far future, but not in 5 to 10 years. Also, do you know why Jack Ma was treated like that ? That's because China has seen what happened in US.  the Tech Giant quickly became Monopoly and drove wealth to fewer and fewer people. The gap between the rich and the poor became wider and wider. China adopted Capitalism for several decades and benefit a lot from it. Now it back fired. So China started to try something nobody has done before, to control the force of Capital and chieve common prosperity. It's a gamble but the chance of winning is at least not neglectable."
"It will not collapse, agreed, but that is because it already has.  China's economy only works in China.  Because it is a police state, when they get caught cheating, they nationalize the companies and hide all records.  However, the fa√ßade is ending and now people see what is going on.  The supply chains are shifting, the real estate is ambulatory, the banks stole everyone's savings.  The Chinese are slaves and will now end up like Cuba.  Just like Russia, no foreign investments , so no more money for their Ponzi scams.  China's fake companies are voluntarily delisting themselves from the US Stock Exchange.  Their numbers can not be quantified as no one can validate them, just like in Russia.  Russia is now not providing any information as the actual state of their economy.  Very soon Russia will run out of storage for their gas and oil, and will be forced to shut down pipelines, at which point, they will basically be shut down for good.  Russia does not know how to maintain and restore them."
How much money does the CCP send you to make propaganda for them?
"Idk if it would collapse..

But the true story is...POOR CHINESE PEOPLE...are going through hell...but since they have no ""free press,"" then that is no damage to China."
"If China üá®üá≥ and it's economy honor Love/God/Allah/the Great Spirit/the Celestial Tao ‚òØÔ∏è..

Love will honor China and it's economy.  If they draw nigh to Love////the Celestial Tao ‚òØÔ∏è  then Love/////the Celestial Tao ‚òØÔ∏è will draw nigh to them. 

I'm reminded of the guy that kept the Ark of the Covenant at his place before King David moved it to the dedicated Temple building .

"Depends on the day of the week:
Mon/Wed/Fri - China is collapsing.
Tue/Thu/Sat - China is a threat.
Sun - let's rest and fabricate next week's lies, maybe Uyghurs? LOL..."
"I understand what you're saying and agree a total collapse will be unlikely. However, their economic collapse is going to be much worse than what you predicted. If I had to compare it to your dice analogy I would say that what you discussed is a rolling a 2 or 3 while total collapse is rolling a 12 (GD is 9/10 and GR is 6/7). It's economic ""collapse"" would be more than likely somewhere in between, but on the lower half around 5 or 6. The reason I disagree is because you relied too much on economics, while sociology, psychology and history was ignored."
"Let's cut to the chase: the worst scenario. See what North Korea is doing? Yes, that is the worst scenario for China, and it will be nothing to worry about. The people of North Korea are still happy and proud, and extremely grateful for the fact that they are living in King Dynasty 3.0. The Chinese people will be at least 10 times happy and more proud than the North Koreans are. That is a promise."
"Thank you for approaching this issue with a level head. 

I had to unsubscribe from channels like Graham‚Äôs because he sensationalizes everything for clicks. It honestly got to a point that I started to get stressed every time I saw one of his thumbnails. Go to his channel or others like it and all of the thumbnails are of their face with a theme of doom and gloom.

Channels like that make so many bold claims, but are wrong 90% of the time but no one notices, so they keep doing it because people click with greater regularity on negative news stories."
"Right.  The government can't cover for the underwater banks, the Chinese can't withdraw money, the CCP hires violent thugs to beat people that gather to protest banks stealing their money, the drought is killing plants, the flooding is washing Chinese to the sea.  By ALL means, just keep telling yourself there is no such thing as a crash and that real estate only goes up.  Genius."
Nice fantasy land analysis.  China is FUC!ED!
"The chinese may not collapse due to those factors, but it can always collapse from other volatile factors, china needs a  lot of fertilisers for its food, pork or rice and both require foreign inputs, but most importantly energy, it is entirely possible that japan could theoretically stop all chinese trade from the south china sea, whether that is actually the case is up to you, but if so that would endanger chinese fuel including for the tractors and the trucks, the indonesians could do the same, and the malays, the thais could similarly complicate things as well as the vietnamese. It is entirely possible, in other words for Japan to have the capabilities to starve china literally, this probably would provoke nuclear war but the mere threat should be worrying enough, meanwhile pirates, if the Japanese, Koreans, or even Indonesia or the Philippines told the americans one day that they wanted to fund pirates to destroy chinese ships and the US just let them, that would have a similar effect."
"It is full of communist corruption. The karma from viciously persecuting Falun Gong is enormous. collapse is imminent. bail your production lines out of china as soon as possible. Hopefully this will mean a change of regime, and not take the good common people down with it."
"1) China cannot be compared to the US or Sri Lanka or anyone else. China's decline will be its own unique story. 2) While this dude does mention some of the problems China is facing, there are many more, happening now or in the offing. Whether China collapses or ""just"" declines, it's coming, and neither Xi nor his banks can stop it."
You look tired shilling for China
At last some common sense. Too much propaganda and clickbait from the West.
"It's a 20 to 30 year slow puncture that will lead to a busted tyre that the Chinese people are paying for due to the C.C.P. failed policies (The debt bubble to date is nearly 300% of G.D.P. {Which is a lot higher than Japan's} and will rise as the C.C.P. will carry out further stimulus infrastructure projects, all funded by the people who are unlikely to revolt about things - so far) but not a blowout,  invading Tawain would make it a blowout! The Chinese economy is a bit like a Ponzi scheme, it's had record growth in a relatively short period of time, based on high levels of mostly hidden internal debt rather than productive growth, the C.C.P. is both the criminal and law enforcement actors so it won't collapse big style as they will disguise this fact for as long as they can, but eventually they will have to stump up and it will be already gone!"
I‚Äôm pretty sure you could find a dozen reasons to make the exact same clickbait video predicting an American collapse in 25 days
"Actually, economist Michael Pettis argues that big economic crash is long term more preferable than decades long stagnation like Japan. While crash is sociopoliticaly very volatile, it essentially resolves the underlying economic problems right then and there while economic stagnation keeps everything on life support but it makes it very hard to resolve those issues. I think crash plus monetary aid to ordinary citizens affected by this (so essentially Keynesian economics) is preferable to political stability and your country never reaching its potential. And I wouldn't say China ""learned"" from great depression, if they learned, they would have avoided creating economic conditions for the crash and as I said above, preventing crash might not be always the best solution."
"Yeah, those headline are very click-bait, but actually I haven't seen any video that stated that China's economy will collapse tomorrow. Nobody seriously thinks that, China can't even be compared to Sri Lanka.
Still, is the only solution you can think about is printing money? You know, that will eventually generate inflation. Lowering interest rates so the real-estate bubble doesn't deflate (that much)? Inflation. Inflation lowers living standards, thus lowering internal consumption, which in turn lowers production, incomes, which slows down the economy. I guess this is called ""recession"".
China is not alone - the EU has around 10% inflation currently, which is unheard of. The US is better off, but not immune. So, we're all in it - China, the West, Russia. The big question is just who will come out of it the best, and it seems the US stands the best of all, and China has a chance of a bigger fall, especially compared to expectations. Compared to the 5.5% growth target, this year will be a disaster for China. It will get farther from overtaking the US, occupying Taiwan remains a wet dream of some CCP officials, and Chinese people will finally realize that there is no such thing as a free lunch.
So yeah, I agree, unless those apes in the CCP go bananas, China will be able to avoid a collapse. Still, they will be no better off than the rest of the world, probably worse."
"The problem is that it costs nothing to make a wrong prediction.  In the future, to be taken seriously, people making predictions should be forced to take a pledge such as: ""I predict that China will collapse in X days, if wrong, I will donate Y amount of money to charity.""  Without a pledge, we can just laugh at all the nonsense."
"The truth is probably somewhere in between. The tough part is the data is all false, most of the money has already left china, it would be interesting to see how the CCP will deal with it however that's not looking good. The 27 day to collapse is definitely utter cow-pie."
"Part of a country or Empire's balance sheet and portfolio should show the number of people it HAS served with the number of people that freely want it to continue to serve them in the future.  Likely future customers IS an asset.  It's an IMPORTANT part of the equation of Economic viability.

"Everyone seems to forget how corrupt their internal systems is, a lot of the points makes sense IF rules were followed.

Goes to show how superficial alot of the replies here have,or lack of when doing or knowing things in china

"Everyone's an expert on the economy and demographics now it seems. 
Looking at these comments makes me weep for humanity."
"It's very hard to find unbiased information about China, and because China is the current ""enemy of the day"" in the US and our economy is faltering and definitely in a bubble that may be on the verge of collapse, so we're hoping really hard that it happens to China instead (it's not). So I'm glad that we have channels like yours and Patrick Boyle's. Of course everything has some type of bias, but there is clearly an attempt not to be biased and to be as neutral as possible. Probably helps that neither of you are American haha."
I am pretty sure that creating hyper-inflation to save the banking system is not going to work out well.
China suppose to have collapsed many many times according to some ‚Äútrue ‚Äú intellectual from CIA. I am waiting.
the western people never really understand China. so mind your own business such as Europe is becoming the third world
"May I ask the Â§ßËÅ™ÊòéÔºåhow about
Forbes's comment that after UKRAINE War, Europe will become the third world within the west world system"
"as much as I hate China, this makes the most sense"
There‚Äôs lots of things that need to be taken into consideration.
Nice to see some common sense
"Complete collapse - no.

Bad times with some impacts across the globalized world, more likely. 

The clickbait is crazy though. T minus what, a couple weeks now? :p 

I'm more concerned with domestic issues in China having ongoing impacts on supply chain issues though :("
"No country would collapse that easy. The saying ‚Äú protest everywhere‚Äù is not true it was just couple of same footages of a same Henan province P2P scam. And some YouTuber looked credible before exaggerated same way, I was just like ok are they smearing all this time? Sometimes we gotta give China a little credit."
"By printing vast amounts of money China will be devaluing the Yuan. China depends on lots of imports. It's the world's largest importer of oil. It imports a lot of food. There have been runs on banks but depositors can't get their money. Manufacturing companies are fleeing China. Many companies have gone broke already. China's two largest markets for its cheap mass produced crap have most consumers in serious financial trouble. 70 percent of the US economy is consumer driven. When you run the numbers of what is China's annual income in US dollars by using GNI/GDP ratio and eliminating PPP at its peak using China's own highly suspicious numbers its income was one fifth of the US with four times the population. 900 million Chinese are dirt poor living on 10 dollars a day or less, half of them on 2 dollars a day or less. The US can bankrupt China any time it wants to. In fact the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Powell said this week it will aggressively raise interest rates until US inflation is reduced to its 2 percent target. Foreign Investors in Chinese corporate real estate bonds were not reimbursed for their losses when the companies defaulted. Chinese investors were. If China stumbles into military conflict over Taiwan it will likely face war with the US and will suffer the same sanctions as Russia. Taiwan will target the Three Gorges Dam killing 450 million people from. Yichang to Shanghai."
"China's depression will be one of the worst in history, but I doubt the CCP can collapse due to economic reasons. We will probably see a fall of the Chinese middle class back to the Maoist era. West is closer to collapse than China because western governments don't have such control and surveillance over their populace as China has. CCP instead sinks its private sector and makes ordinary people's lives terrible rather than facing the collapse of the public sector and possible regime change."

"No, China‚Äôs economy won‚Äôt collapse like America‚Äôs or Sri Lanka‚Äôs, which is a more appropriate / less clickbaity title for your video, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt collapse. Especially with sky high unemployment rates, a huge collapse on the manufacturing sector 2nd quarter, millions of businesses going under during each of these last two years, and another 10 million college graduates about to get a rude awakening when they join the workforce this coming fall. 

Man, my entire generation is either laid off, fighting each other over a $1/h sweatshop position, or toiling away in 996 hell with constant fears of their companies being clobbered to death by Xi next. Trust me, if you‚Äôve personally felt the chilling winds blow here as I have, you‚Äôd have a completely different take on what‚Äôs ‚Äúfear-mongering‚Äù and what is ‚Äúa gross understatement.‚Äù Those of us who are more well off are literally burying gold into our back yards (too bad none of us actually own a backyard)‚Ä¶since it‚Äôs better to blow all your money on what luxury items still available, than have your bank account forcefully confiscated into some ‚Äúmandatory housing purchase fund,‚Äù or digitized into the aether never to be seen again.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶any Chinese whose not completely brain dead understand completely what this government is capable of, in a sense we are way more sensitive when the political wind changes directions. Countless millions were starved to death under this exact system, and - will you look at that - the current leader actually idolizes Mao, so the great dying might very well happen again. Xi‚Äôs fetish towards returning to the simpler times of ‚Äúelegant, Maoist, closed economy,‚Äù is also the only realistic way to ensure party dominance in this brave new world (the CCP‚Äôs ‰ºüÂ§ßÂ§çÂÖ¥&ÂÜÖÂæ™ÁéØpolicies spells out Xi‚Äôs wet dream pretty straightforwardly, the media literally hails him as the leader that saved the party from capitalistic color revolution). This seals the country‚Äôs fate, as we will walk even further on the path of extreme nationalism, militarism, and North Korean-ism‚Ä¶"

"China's economy will not collapse, and it will not fall into stagnation like Japan. In China, unfinished buildings and banks have been solved in many areas. China does not have the chaebol like Japan. Although the economy is in difficulties, there are still some people who start their own businesses.  Provide new economic growth points, especially in the manufacturing industry, the economy still has huge potential, I am not sure whether China's economic growth can be as fast as before, but it will certainly not collapse or stagnate, I don't believe it will be seen in a few years"
Refreshing to watch a different take on the situation in China.
Stupid westerners are jealous they want china to collapse but deep down they know it won‚Äôt happen or last long. China has a superior political system uniquely resistant to the weaknesses of capitalism.
"The Japan scenario IS a collapse.  The Nikkei index still hasn't recovered its 1990 high of 37500 and we're 30 years on.  The Nikkei dropped 50% in 2 years from 1990-1992, then the economy stagnated for 15 years.  Comparing that as a most likely scenario for China seems pretty catastrophic from where I'm sitting."
"A balanced and much needed corrective to the alarmism on youtube about China.  China is in trouble but is not on the verge of collapsing.  He makes a good case for a Japan style stagnation scenario instead.  But you never know, maybe Peter Zeihan is right."
"Well.. The China government (aka communist party) will still suppress these issues.. They are good at suppression for the past 6 decades.
And China's economy will still go on regardless the banking system problem, housing mortgage payment issues and others... They will lie, cheat, steal or even sink it.. Their people may get upset but will soon start to show down.. They are used to it.."
China The Experiment communist government with capitalist business system anyone's guess to see what's going to happen.
So true.
How did it take this long for a video like this to come out
One other thing is that ev sales are 30% of all vehicle sales currently 90% by 2026.  Soon China will not require us $ to buy yuan.  China will buy all it's oil from from Russia and Iran in yuan.

"There is a 1/36th probability of any double number on a 2 dice roll, so your analogy about a double 4 more likely than a double 6 is wrong, aside from that, great video!"
"""EASILY offset the effect of fleeing international investors."" ü§î

I'm pretty sure they were able to accumulate those dollars due to international investors. 

What sort of domestic economic activity will replace the international investment?"
China is definitely in trouble economically. But it really depends on what your definition of collapse is. It will probably look more like the Japanese economic collapse in the 90s. It‚Äôs not like everything is going to fall apart but a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money.
"Hey, what do you think of the Chinese Railroad Crisis? It's something that has gone under the radar for most economy channels. But I find it a very interesting topic.
China Railroad is running a massive deficit due to this having been a prestige project for the Chinese government and officials.
While it used to be extremely profitable, as it was originally built between the busiest cities, it has now been expanded to much into areas that barely has any passangers.
And the local governments of the deficit-lines are now pouring in millions of not billions of money to keep it running.
Do you think this will have any impact of the overall financial  crisis of China?"
Thats a very good analysis
"Essentially, a lot of people don't like China. So, there's a lot of demand for news and narratives that the country is about to collapse. Whether its true or not isn't really important to the people who seek out that kind of content."
No collapse and that is why they put tanks in front of some banks.
"‚ÄúAppear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.‚Äù  ‚Äï Sun Tzu, The Art of War"
"Video was good but then ended with the same old ""China will stagnant and decline"" narrative that we've been hearing for 40+ years. And the whole capital flight narrative is so overblown, in fact FDI is up 20% this year. China will continue to grow an average of 5% every year this decade."

"Yeah, China‚Äôs not going to suddenly collapse, but they are cruising for a bruising.

Edit: Speaking long term, do you think it‚Äôs possible that China could lose its safeguard of product manufacturing?  Say, with a lot of companies eventually moving to other parts of Asia or even Africa?"
Awesome! Going back to the roots of the channel; debunking popular YouTube theories
Most readers seem to believe what they want to believe.
Wrong. China's economy doesn't function in a bubble. Credit collapse imnent due to default of payment and lack of availability to source funds. Dollar strengthening means also china will drain reserve in short order. China central bank can print all they want but the economy is also reliant on outside natural resources to produce. They don't have the funds to pay for that
Excellent video man üëç
It's interesting you say Japan style decline? Would the u.s ever face something like that and how does a country recover from something like that?
The long-term outlook for China isn't great due to it's rapidly rising ratio of the elderly vs the working population. It's a global issue but nowhere is it hitting as hard as in China.
stop watching the news and youtube tying to find the truth... live your live and don t worry what's happening around...
seriously no one has a clue with anything
"China has lots of small banks, which should actually help prevent collapse as it endures money is still going into the real economy."
"In the end, what's worse, a sudden collapse vs stagnation followed by a slow decline? What happened to Japan was worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s."
"I guess we'll have to wait 5 years or so to see what actually happens.    No one really knows, probably."
China is imploding from within.  China's people are in high distress due to more than just global economic situations.  That's just one problem.  They have many others.
"I agree.  After all these years of economic sanctions and political pressure from the international community,  has North Korea collapsed or has Cuba collapsed?  No on both counts."
"The Japan style stagnation is in part caused by the ""voluntary"" export restrictions imposed by the US.
The US will have learned now from their disastrous sanctions policy for Russia and will be careful not to destroy their own economy.
Seen many videos of China bashers. One from a self-proclaimed criminal and another claiming to be a millionaire but stil needs your YouTube clicks to make a living and advising you to invest in crypto currency. They all have a hidden agenda."
Very insightful. Thank you!
"The US also has capital controls, I think it is worth noting. If you leave the country the government will apply an exit tax, which is in total assets."
"What time in history has a trade surplus or capital control prevented ill effects of currency printing? You said ""China's monetary independence gives them the freedom to print as much of its own currency as it wants to rescue it's banking system."" When has this happened in history?"
I think propaganda war is always on in some shape ü§î
"Hitting double 5 or 4 is not more likely than hitting double 6, its the same probability."
"Xi sanction on ""productive tech"" and ""edu industries"", not a bad things in china. Jack Ma destory the retail shop for many years since Alibaba grow as the gaint.  Xi want  to improve the chips ability that can get more profit and Competitiveness therfor turn the china from manufacture to high tech. For chip processes below 14nm, China has occupied a major share of the market in next years. the US chips stock will not doing well in 2023 or future. (this is not invest advice,  only have KEYSIGHT on my portflio.)"
"The time frame is their main mistake. China is going down in slow motion. When the demographic crisis peaks their economy will implode. Without the entire political regime being replaced, defusing the complex economic bomb that has been built up over decades is implausible."
"what you don't know that human capabilities can influence the outcomes of a dice, proven in Tawla , backgammon or any dice game ... you just cant identify how they can do it !!"
I honestly think these content creators are propagandists for the C C P; they were enlisted to create a sort of complacency that china is not going to be a threat anymore.
"well, they are destroying  MANY  empty skyscrapers in ghost cities to rebuild them ,  China is an expert at gaming GDP metrics"
I don't really think that kind of YouTubers are  seriousü§£ Anti-China is a good business on YouTube.
China collapse is good or bad to the world? Yes or No? Please comment
"As much as i want china to collapse, it's good to see some rational explanation"
"Of course it won't. It's part of the narrative to crash the markets and justify the high inflation. The asset bubble happened in any developed country at some point and none of them collapsed. China is self sufficient in tech, manufacturing and, with the assistance of Russia, cheaper access to raw materials and energy."
"Excellent analysis, their growth will be severely stunted and there will be pain but there won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù."
China's economy is collapsing. üòÇ
"However, and further to my recent comment, I do think that the economic problems we are commenting on will contribute to major political problems that may well eventually see the end of the CCP's reign as the country falls victim to its historical centripetal tendencies - which usually involves civil war."
"""Collapse"" sounds more like a recession type of things from other channels. Not a Sir Lanka style. Click bait."
"As a former spook  who lived through the collapse of Japan's Bubble Keizai,  I agree with your criticism of the hysterical Doom and Gloom ""China Collapse""  crowd for the reasons you give and think that we will see a repeat of Japan's lost decades muddle through scenario. Keep up the good work."
"China has a bunch of compounded problems though;

1. Economy
2. Population bust
3. Lack of water
4. Lack of reliable oil channels
5. Xis insistence of killing the messenger

These five challenges combined makes China extremely vulnerable right now. We'll see what happens though. :)"
"Finally someone that brings logic, mathematics and actual political facts about China. You also understand how the politics work in China where other youtubers utterly fail.

Thanks for this, its nice to see another intelligent person make a smart deduction on the matter"
"Wouldn't the odds of rolling double 6 be the same as any other double? How are double 5, 4 or 3 any more likely?"
Thanks for your analysis
can u do a vid on how to look at us corporate bonds? how to tell if the company will go bankrupt or default plz
I mostly agree but doesn‚Äôt China face a future moral hazard situation with the Central Banks basically allowing negligible actions?
"No China won‚Äôt fail! They can just print money and institute price controls if it gets bad!! That always works right?!

Depression was caused by interventionism fool 

LOL 

The Chinese are finished"
Pretty sure those YouTubers are somehow receiving some of that 500 million the US Congress earmarked for subsidizing anti China propaganda
Their are some racist people in the west that wants to see china collapse because they don't want to see a rise of a strong china that can overtake the west.

"""Finance Youtubers"", the best case of FAKE NEWS."
"excellent presentation, I learn so much in a short time"
"This channel makes more sense, those people who wish china to crumble also have no brain, the dependency on Chinese goods only means that if China does collapse, the US and the EU will only achieve higher inflation than the current one most likely double or triple. It is no different than wishing for a monetary suicide. I don't understand why people want to cut their own arms and legs but apparently, they do."
"While crying that ""China will collapse in 28 days!"" is little more than clickbait nonsense, the idea that China is heading towards a catastrophic down turn is very real. 

The elephant in the room that this video, and many others, overlook, is the fact that China is facing a demographic collapse which makes the ones in the majority of the developed world look like a joke. Not only does China have a massive percentage of its population moving past it's most productive period, but they also have nowhere near the number of younger people necessary to replace them due to a combination of urbanization, the one child policy, and sex selective abortions.

No country in history has ever walked out of population collapse without major social, economic, and political upheaval. China is already a tenuous house of cards, as is. Large swaths of their economic are outright fabricated, they're dependant upon imports of just about every from sealines protected by other nations, and they're losing foreign investment they rely on to prop up the insane printing their banks do to countries with less restrictions and keeper labour markets. 
All things considered, China, as we know it today, will be lucky if it manages to make it another two decades in its current position."
But will have a long long period like Japan in the '90s and '00s. Much long than Japan did.
sold all my nio and alibaba bought yxi F_china
"English is not my first language but I still think I can make some senses here. I do agree that it is hard to judge Chinese economy only based on one or few aspects, but it is also not normal to see big tech companies like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu are significantly down sizing their market values/ stock prices for the past couple years.

The largest real estate company in China - Evergrande, recently drop down the price of some of their new homes more than 50% overnight. Lots of people have already pre-paid the full amount, but once the price dropped they cannot get their money back. You have to know the housing prices are so high in China (comparing with their average earnings), buying a house is a much much more important decision than in the US/ Canada, you could literally lose your entire life savings/ money for retirement if you make a bad decision.  

People are losing jobs, let off at work because of the pandemic and government lock downs, lots of Chinese factories have to shut down their business because of they just simply cannot get workers to come to work. Other factories then have to slow down/ pause their business because the supply chain is disconnected. Transportations, shipping for supplies also became extremely hard to arrange and the wait time/ price also get tripled. If you are in a business to getting supplies from China, you will understand what I'm talking about here. People now in China are fighting for jobs. lots of new posting jobs require the applicants to at least have a master's degree. Even for a office clerk position. Some of my Chinese friends call this situation 'Nei Juan' aka, involution. I won't explain it too much here because it is irrelevant to this topic.


Chinese government makes zero covid police so strict and they gave each of the Chinese citizens a health code, and people are tracking down by the government at all time. If they have determined that you might be exposed to one of the people who has covid at anytime. Doesn't matter if you are on the same subway train or go to the same supermarket buying groceries, everybody will get a notice from their health code aka yellow code then you cannot return to your home/ apartment until you get a covid test again showing you are negative. If one city found multiple red code (Covid positive) suddenly appears in a day, they will either force everyone from that city to get a covid test or possibly lock down the entire city for couple days or more. If you live in China or have business travel to China recently, you know what I'm talking about. Having the entire multi million population covid test is very costly, and the money does not just appears from nowhere, in fact, they were taking all those money from their social healthcare fund. This fund is design like a social welfare only for medicares, and because of this fund, poor people in China can get their daily medicines for a relatively affordable price. Now this fund is nearly empty, and the government starts taking down lots of common medicines off from the plan. If you are middle class or upper class you probably don't give a shit, because you might just have your own private health plan. But for the poor class, you are absolutely doomed if you are sick.  

Recently, Some of my Chinese friends have told me that because of the pandemic and the fear of housing price bubble, lots of people chose not buy houses right now. However, lots of new buildings and houses construction are already started, the real estate companies have already borrowed the money from the banks. If they cannot sell the new houses on time, they simply cannot pay back to the banks. And then WORST thing happened, lots of people pre-paid their new houses, but the real estate companies don't have the money to finish up the construction... The Chinese government and banks (state owned) are still forcing those people to start paying back mortgages even they cannot move into the new homes, or their credit score will be damaged. In China, with a damaged credit score means you can no longer buy a train ticket, a flight ticket or borrow any money from the banks etc. Because the Chinese banks and the government are basically in the same gang, they need to help the real estate companies to collect the money quickly so they can get their money back. They started lowering the interest rate for purchasing new homes, but also increased the interest rate for the second hand housing market for borrowers. Also the banks keep lending money to those real estate companies and try to fill up the empty holes. 

I believe most economy collapses or depressions are originated from people's bad decisions, especially the bad decisions were made by the government. If you disagree, please forgive me ;c."
Nice to see another source of information and point of view after all the clickbaiting.
"China economy will not collapse as are busy looting the poorer African/Latin and poorer East Europian countries. Look at Ghana loss of their minerals and oil. They evade paying taxes overseas by bribing corrupt officials and prop up corrupt government's ie.State funded.In India, Chinese phone companies were caught the same way. Its only one Sector property property fluctuates. Covind made them rich by selling PPI's. Sri Lanka ought to hold China responsible for its collapse loss of revenue holiday sector also lent them money for roads etc...which they knew could not pay back."
#runphilosophy #lastgeneration #letitrot
"So the claims ‚Äúwill collapse‚Äù and ‚Äúwill not collapse‚Äù are both questionable and both stupid.

Historically, all dominant economies have collapsed or gone out of power at some point in time, it is obvious that china can‚Äôt reign forever, just like every other economy, so anyone defending it saying ‚Äúunlikely to collapse‚Äù or ‚Äúwill not collapse‚Äù is either God, a time traveler, or an idiot. But the situation at hand asks ‚Äúhow long until it does?‚Äù That‚Äôs a poorly worded question because it reffers to ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù and not ‚Äú hardship‚Äù. China is in hardship right now, just like most europe and us and everyone will agree, period. China is experiencing economic hardship. And because it‚Äôs showing similar events to previous historical downturns in strong economies, people are gambling on a great chinese depression. But the problem comes different, ‚Äúhow do countries act when they have a communist leader and it leads them in a extreme downturn?‚Äù It‚Äôs not good enough to look only at the economic factors but also the social events. ‚ÄúLets compare other collapsing economies from asia‚Äù but not ‚Äúlets compare similar events in communist lead countries historically‚Äù.  Because you know, a country is nothing without the people. And as you will see answers vastly differ. The video does an OK job AT MOST of arguing that it will not complitely collapse and potentially divide, but not arguing that it will not continue to experience long term hardship, which made a ‚Äúbank run‚Äù look like a ‚Äúoh yeah that‚Äôs not a problem cause they can just pump money with no other effects‚Äù."
"Quite right. It will definitely be a Japan style stagnation. However, unlike Japan where there is not much social unrest, mass unemployment or underemployment could cause a lot of social unrest. Unless the CCP can handle this unrest, the government may fall."
They're just trying to stop their YouTube channels from collapsing
excelente video
Agreed.  There is so much indoctrinating hype in all forms of mass media in the 21st century.  The volume of prairie muffins being thrown around boggles the mind.  Study the mainland Chinese economy from 1972 (the Nixon visit) to 2022 (Emperor Xi).
Your video is clearly being promoted by someone lmao literally YouTube exposed you üòÇüòÇüòÇ
So China won‚Äôt collapse because the central bank will just print money to bail out bank depositors?  If this happens on a big scale it will prevent a deflationary collapse but cause an inflationary one instead.  Printing money has got to be the worst explanation of why an economy/currency will not collapse.  Lol
"Thank you Joeri. I too feel that the click batey videos on China are out of hand. I didn't know where to turn to to get the right information so I'm glad you did this video.

Cheers!"
You're very objective. Subscribed your Chanel
"China is facing tough times. Demographic collapse, many of the workers are now in their 50s and there are nowhere near the replacements. Globalization is ending. The only way China was able to grow to be the economic powerhouse it is was due to the US Navy ensuring the sea lanes for importing raw materials (and fuels) and exporting. a couple subs in the Indian Ocean could stop the oil. China has few friends in it's neighborhood (North Korea?) China is having civil unrest as well as climate change issues."
"It's reported that China printed 12 trillion recently to delay the burst of the debt bubble.
It's that only the livelihood of Chinese people will deteriorate and some may go bankrupt, but the government is in full control,  their grip on power upon the population is as strong as  in North Korea."
"China is not only going to collapse, it already has its fate written in stone. China's demographic, Chinese labour's value went up x13 times since the 90s, making it now as expensive as US citizens, and so, undesirable. Also the pig issue that is making China rely more and more on rice, and lack of water resources. Another is the fact that China is ruled by a dictator that has cut out the middle man all together, so no bad news is sent to him. But the biggest one is the US foreign policy to slowly but surely about stopping patrolling the oceans, because this was something done to bribe countries from being part of the Soviet Union, and since the 90s, it's been about closing bases abroad, and so, the US won't sacrifice their army, so that China can be an empire. China imports 86% of the energy it uses, and companies are slowly stopping business with Chinese companies. China wants to be closed from the world, yet it depends on it to exist in its form. They don't have the population to keep the output, let alone grow. Empires rise and fall, China is one of them. After that is Persian Gulf and how the US leaving, makes Saudi Arabia the next Congo"
"The property surpluses are mostly in Tier 3-4 Cities. Not in Tier-1 , Beijing and Shanghai. Property prices worldwide also have fallen from the peak especially in smaller cities."

we will listen to various versions of China's collapse once a year.Although it is true that the economy is facing difficulties, we don't think we will collapse."

"In-fact among the countries or audience that are obsessed about China collapse are America and Japan-this doesn't surprise me given their anti China rant. What really is hilarious is countries like India, Vietnam that has trouble feeding its own people yet worry about China's collapse."
That's a pretty level-headed analysis. Thanks for the insight.
"Its called the China Hatred or China Collapse Mesturbation. These so called China doomsayers have predicted China's collapse - 20 years ago. This includes all type of so called Western Media, The Chinese can't give a foot f about what others think about China nor do they wait to be liberated by anybody-why the obsession about them; mainly from Japan and America."
"The world is completely delirious about China because of the media and hateful speech bt China is Smart, they know the opinions that matter, "" the people of China"" We always think that they are brainwashed by their government bt we are also brainwashed into hating China."

"Furthermore China has over 3 trillion US dollars in its forex reserves, therefore they're not short of US dollars to maintain economic stability."
"You are ignoring a fundamental difference between the 2008 bubble in the US and the current bubble in China.

"China's economy will slow down though, that's just clear, they have too much internal shit going on for it not to. No, not collapse, but slowing down will hurt China."

"just think of it...almost all raw materials china have it. chips, clothes, agriculture, hi-tech stuff that you can rebrand."
Guess we just found out who got influenced(paid) to spread negative news about China
"I think so ...because of the best manufacturing  and mastering raw materials  as well as  chain distribution ...china is no way at deficits ...(1) ..üòÑüòÉüòÄ

The slow down of world economy may affect the size of surplus but it can be encountered by keeping stable currency and reducing value currency at the lower limit ( but still in the range)  by printing remimbi to compensate the surplus ...(2) ...üòÑüòÉüòÄ

The yield of interest from BRI invested( 1T from 2013) is another independent surplus to  the state revenue ...(3) .üòÑüòÉüòÄ

"AFAIK 1) I would agree that the ""collapse in days"" youtubers are clickbait clowns.  2) I would agree that the chinese govt has planned for and is managing their position well, and that in the short term they will handle the contractions.  3) However, along with other geostrategic analysts it's almost impossible to envision china maintaining its advantage in manufacturing, escaping the middle income trap, completing its journey to a competitor to the west, and the chinese government maintaining domestic legitimacy, when the population is half that of India and only equal to that of the west, unless it reverses course on belligerance."
"Thanks, finally someone making some sense."
Take a look at the Walk East channel to see for yourself whether China declines in population and economic crises‚Ä¶.  https://youtube.com/c/WalkEast
"Strongly agree with all of this video. It just still pains me to think about a Japan stagnation scenario -- with China not yet out of the middle income bracket, so many more people will suffer under a stagnation than in Japan. But that may have become inevitable since long ago.
There are other spill over risks from this stagnation, such as tensions with neighboring countries, as without the cohesion provided by prosperity the government has to pump up nationalist sentiment. Hopefully the Russian invasion into Ukraine is enough of a deterrence for now."
i was waiting for until 0 day which i can mock them for fun
I agree. China will not collapse. The government has the power and the resources to prop up its economy. It is an autocratic state remember?
This is by far the most sensible YouTube video on this subject.
Ok finally someone came up
Great breakdown and explanation of the China situation. Much more plausible than most of the click bait videos I‚Äôve seen.
man fuck banks.
funny flemish fella is based and not bought by wuhu chans
enfin un peu de bon sens ... La Chine a CHOISI elle m√™me de d√©gonfler la bulle sp√©culative pour se pr√©parer aux temp√®tes qui arrivent .
"Well explained, China's economy will not go into recession, as it has already, started monetary easing, most importantly, for  120 countries, China is their biggest trading partner, and another 40 they are the 2nd largest trading partner. The lock downs never really paralysed China, this year, to have had a gdp growth, in 2019 was 6%, while every western nation had negative growth. The 1st half of 2022 China has 2.5%. While all western countries have had 2 sessions of negative gdp, which is in fact, they are in recession. The most relevant issue is the national savings of its citizens which in the last estimate was said  to be around usd 50 trillion. Since travel abroad has almost come to a stand still domestic travel and tourism will be enhanced, with a greater velocity of money on foods and services."
Only American and its allies spread this lies to brainwashed the ignorant who are on their side. America is a driver and the rest are passengers who don't know how to drive own batio
"As a Chinese, I want to correct a few small mistakes.

First of all, the one-child policy must actually be implemented, and this policy is correct both theoretically and practically.The consumption level of ten Indian farmers cannot be compared with that of one Chinese engineer.A huge population base, if it can't be transformed into industry and industrial chain, is just a burden.

In the 1990s, China really couldn't provide enough jobs, and even today, China's competition intensity is the highest in the world.If there is no one-child policy, China will increase its population by at least 400 million. If there is no war of external expansion, China will collapse even if there is no economic crisis.

Second, although the education and Internet industries provide many high-income jobs for China, the crisis brought by monopoly and capital supremacy is even more serious.

Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, as well as tiktok, four large super enterprises monopolize almost all areas of China's Internet. Small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing enterprises, and game design studios have to pay sky-high fees to gain development space in the monopoly of giants.The education industry has also led to a large number of outstanding teachers transferring to private tutoring institutions, and the education cost of ordinary Chinese is expensive.This is intolerable as a socialist country."
"When in doubt, go for thr non-sansationalist take on a subject. I like that you acknowledge a possibility of a rapid collapse but suggest that a slow decline is more likely. The CCP has total control of the country and that allows it to do things that would be impossible in a country with divided powers and protection of individual rights.

Good video! Cheers."
Most of us wants china to fail they are the bully of asia countries
"The sad thing is there is a much higher probability of collapse of US/EU economies!

That China is collapsing is good click-baity speaks volume of today's ignorance.
This video is based on the video by SerpentZA.
"Chinese people have tasted capitalism, commies are gna learn real quick getting folks of crack, civilisations collapse fairly quickly as information moves faster"
"""Because china cares about stability, they wont collapse""? What kind of argument is this? Sure the videos lately on youtube are exaggerated but you cant just wave off the problems"
"Thanks Prof for your analysis. Frankly, I was beginning to get tired of the click baity stories that just plagiarized one another. I agree with you that a Japan-style slow decline is more plausible. Keep fact-checking them...(hope they don't brand you a CCP apologistü§¶üèΩ)"
"This china shill mentions ways in which china 'could' avoid total collapse. But to date, they haven't done the things mentioned, china's banks ARE robbing citizens of their savings so far AND their real estate industry has collapsed to the point people refuse to pay their mortgages any longer, AND chinese factories are shutting down at record rates. This is a shallow and superficial survey of the current chinese economic situation. The MAIN difference between US and China economic crashes is that the chinese citizen has no recourse whatsoever, the government couldn't care less about the average chinese citizen's problems. The CCP is a government that PURPOSELY starved 10's of millions of it's own citizens. I wonder how much in contributions Schasfoort receives from the CCP to paint these phony rosy pictures."
"I was laughing at those thumbnails as well, such as ""Collapsing in 29 days"" I was like, ok we shall see üòÇ like it is so obvious that they've unrealistic expectations or predictions. Also, people will literally call you China's paid puppet when literally you're a true professional speaking the truth. They rather listen to fake news just to satisfy themselves."
"I agree theres too much clickbaity nonsense when it comes to China, however All these points are somewhat irrelevant compared to the main problem of china, which is a collapsing demographics. Its population has already peaked and now is on its way down."

It‚Äôs delusional and uneducated to think china or US is collapsing‚Ä¶ lol
"I agree, China will enter a period similar to Japan, a period of Stag-Deflation which will last for decades! 
China doesn't know how to get out of its situation because it doesn't have a domestic market. Just like Japan, China has started to believe in its own propaganda; in the 1980's Japan thought it was a bigger economy than the USA. Much to their demise! I love Japan. 
China has a false economy, Richard Nixon opened up the USA to Mao Ze Dong, and thanks to that China's economy boomed, and US Manufacturing jobs got smashed by a Republican President who hated workers! China has been printing money for decades and this was good while its population kept on growing but now it has hit the demographic cliff face! Yes China is going to copy Japan; stag deflation for 4 to 5 decades! And there is no way out of this! 
Along with China Stag Deflation will also hit many other countries like Russia, North Korea, Canada, Japan (Where it will continue but more modestly than it has been for the last 4 decades), Brazil, etc.
I am sorry to say Morning Brew, you are out of Oompf, to say the least!"
I do not see how a country with little external debt and no capital flight can collapse.
Lol - I‚Äôve been laughing my ass off at the level of stupidity on these videos.
"Good to see someone watched SerpentZA review on these stupid ""countdown to collapse"" videos. 
See- You Gotta Understand China!"
"I cannot believe the lack of intelligence in America.   I live in China here.   This is a place where the government cares about the people.   This is a place where there is a a REAL GDP, not like the American GDP where nothing is actually produced.   Lastly most homes here are OWNED.   Where is a crash possible?"
"LOL, you don't need a PhD to tell"
So you don't think that China well be like Japan in the 90s?
Because you're not talking about China collapsing and not meeting the needs of the anti-China crowd! That's why your video viewership is low.üòÅ
CHINA is becoming the Worlds largest economy and Their currency will soon REPLACE the US Dollar. OUR OWN Government is working to Insure it
You're the first economics youtuber to actually make me excited for a new video
"china will collapse... is collapsing and will be worst, the demographics alone will destroy china, in one way or another, the most probably is a chinesse collapse... it depend of what we understand as a collapse"
"CCP insider politics playing out now will decide the outcome of China's real estate crisis. Xi tried to make himself dictator in the manner of Mao, reviving old line Chinese Communist thinking. But he is now challenged by many in the Chinese Communist Party who want neither a dictator figure nor old style CCP policies (like covid lockdowns) that alienate many Chinese citizens. There will be a struggle in the big CCP leadership meeting happening next month."
"You cant comparing sri-lanka with china,  and you avoid a big big problem in china is corruption and we dont know how the china reserve are. i dont say you're wrong, but your video lacks some parameters."
"Finally,  thank you"
"Also lets not forget about the fact that China is not a democracy by any means. The CCP has total control, the kind many westerners can't imagine. If they want to stop/change something, they will find a way because they can't be questioned and if anyone dares to contradict them, those will be silenced and punished."
Thank you for bringing a sober perspective!
Aren‚Äôt you denial
"As long as i can remember from social media and YouTube economists and historian piggybankd by uncle Sam, i have been reading this shit in Economists magazine and shitshows of Youtubers."
Wow !! Terrific !! Information here is conveyed in the clearest way...much better than your competitors. Great job !!
"The US great recession has nothing to do with ""greedy corpos"" trying to get rich quick - the government introduced incentives for banks to give out bad mortgages by promising that government (through state backed institutions) would back any bad mortgage - because politicians promised everyone needs to own a house. This isn't even some sort of conspiracy, there's literally no single deregulation that can be attributed to 2008. Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) and Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) were pressured by the Clinton and Bush Sr and Jr adminstrations to lend out to ""low income individuals"" - AKA people who can't pay back their loans.
The NYT predicted it 
[YT wont let me post links] ""fannie mae eases credit to aid mortgage lending""
And BTW parroting this ""greedy corpos"" narrative only emboldens the government to promise more free stuff and bad incentives while claiming the free market is evil and greedy when that shit eventually backfires

That out of the way, the CCP having a controlled demolition of their economy is still a bubble popping and millions of dollars being whipped out. With all these new regulations, all the CCP is doing is kicking the can down the road while slowly strangling the economic outlook  of its own economy - so if its not going to ""2008 crash"" it will certainly not going to get back to ""pre 2008 numbers"" like the US."
It‚Äôs sooner than that
"Double 5, double 4 or any other double result with 2 dice is as common as double 6 is."
"So let me make sure I've got this straight.  China's economy won't collapse because they can just create more money, but they won't just collapse from hyper inflation because they have a trade surplus and capital controls.  How do a trade surplus or capital controls protect from domestic inflation?  

The US hasn't collapsed simply because of monetary independence.  Debt creation doesn't cause hyper inflation because it doesn't go directly into the economy, it goes into assets. When the bubble pops they lower interest rates.  But that only works until you hit 0.  Because the US holds reserve currency, there's also an offshore market for USD that stopped lending through Covid.

Do you think China will just go to negative interest rates like Japan then?"
Ya forgot to say paid and sponsored by the CCP
China will be struggling for and after the next 50 years due to thier aging population high depts by local people and foreign and local state dept. With massive bubble in the housing market. China is going to become like Japan very soon but where more people are in poverty. As no country can support an aging population with one of the fastest shrinking population in the world. Things move slow but China is fed
"People want China to fail so bad, it's almost pathetic and sad"
"Clearly China has or is losing its reputation for foreign investors as it bleeds them which will in future slow down this economic input while at the same time US sanctions is reducing the growth of the manufacturing/export engine further curtailing input of wealth. The CCP's desire for a stable society that accepts and does not complain is going to be sorely tested, 30 years of capitalism has created aspirations can the lid be kept on it."
Graham Stephan has nothing better to do‚Ä¶
"I think one of the great question of our time is if China will follow the path of Japan. One thing I'm sure, there will be no Plaza Accord with China."
"If the Dutch survived a tulip crash, surely the Chinese can survive a property crash.

This coupled with far greater interventionism from China then the Dutch, something which ironically makes recovery harder, just look at the depression and the Soviet *economy* (though Soviet economics shouldn‚Äôt be measured the same was as western economies, if only because the ethos is different).

TLDR China is fine unless it fucks the duck, which it probably won‚Äôt."
"well said, i get really turn off to hear those china collapse bullshit, not that i support china, but to really understand the fact whats happening. juts look at US with all their debts of 28trillons. China is having problem but it not the end."
This was a very good video
"Only sensationalists say that China will collapse into a depression, but a recession in China has far more of an impact on the politics of China than it does in the West.
In the West, the public criticize the Govt, the Govt can only do so much of a bad policy before there is a backlash that could hurt them electorally, we are used to Boom/Bust (whilst China has only ever known the Boom), and our system's legitimacy isnt questioned by a recession.
In China or any totalitarian system, the reactions and overreactions of the tyrants will lead to their collapse, as the People do the only thing they can do. If one cant vote out a govt, one will have to overthrow a govt."
"You have pointed out many differences between the US and China, but you've only done it from the perspective of what people are able to see outside the borders of China, and what the Chinese government even allows its own people to see. You talk about it being a manufacturing superpower, it definitely was, but you fail to mention that many investors are fleeing China due to one simple reason, which leads us to the biggest difference, Communism! Which you didn't even mention, and this is the root of all of Chinas problems, from the economy, to the environment, social interactions, etc etc etc (the corruption in this nation is just staggering and the capital outflows from corrupt officials more than makes up for the strict government controls). Let's talk about something else you haven't mentioned, they're a massive importer, and not of simple trinkets, of some of the necessities most countries must have, coal, oil, gas, food, etc. When you consider how they handle diplomacy, do you honestly believe that they could survive without maintaining good foreign relations? No they can't, even if they're totally delusional, which Communists normally are, they have terrible diplomacy. Right now they have a tenable relationship with Russia, but the history of relations between these two nations is one of mistrust and regular disagreements. It's definitely not a guarantee that they can maintain stable relations with Russia, if you doubt that just look at how they've handled their relations with India, another nation that's part of BRICS, meant to be their ally. People also never talk about the environmental problems China has, the ruling party has been the instigator of the destruction of most of the arable land within China (wasteful infrastructure, more corruption), and now with recent weather abnormalities they're really facing problems. I agree with you that China is not the US, not even close, because the systems are completely different, but China is probably more like, not exact but close, the old Soviet Union, and we all know what happened there. Yes they have capitalism but the world is starting to realize that it's a perverted form of capitalism that the government can seize at any moment. I fully agree that the click bait on many of these other videos about 30 days or 20 days is ridiculous, and obviously is a means to entice more viewership, but the facts I've mentioned here make it very probable that China has many difficult years ahead. People also don't understand how much worse China is now than when the Communists first took over under Mao; arable land, technology, population numbers, population age, basic population intelligence and psychology, which will also makes a massive difference to what happens in the next decade for China. People sensationalize a topic, but never fully grasp all the factors at play and how all of these combined can effect an outcome. The other factor that is unknown, is the Chinese people, once they realize that Communism and the Chinese traditions, culture and history are completely different things, they might become a little more unwilling to just accept what the Communist Party has to say about the direction the country should go. Communism is a western ideology and has absolutely nothing to do with Chinese people and their real history, culture and traditions. One such belief is acceptance of the natural flow and the relationship between heaven and the physical realm to eventually flow naturally towards the good and reject the bad, with recent natural events this definitely seems to be the case."
"China will not collapse. They will slowly lose economic leverage. We all knew they have too much power to collapse. With the new energy independence policies and decrease in fossil fuel reliance, and with nations using AI in manufacturing, China will lose its manufacturing power and hence its economic leverage."
I expect a Japan scenario but with less stagnation and a bit more inflation as they print a bit more to preemptively avoid getting into a liquidity trap. But demographics is still a problem for both China and Europe in the next few decades.
He looks like a drunk in a bar
"There is one simple step to find the same conclusion for every country ,when government start to treat his own peoples like a cattle then you know who is going where."
I'm not sure if you over simplified and left out the other issues to make the video easier but there is also an environment disaster going on there and you can't forget the high speed rail debt they have not saying your incorect but I noticed you didn't factor those in. I'm honestly not trying to be rude.
"All these YT personalities have one interest‚Ä¶ clicks‚Ä¶ and they watch the trend lines on what ‚Äútopic is hot‚Äù and will make any video on the topic‚Ä¶ spit out any gibberish to make it fit the trend narrative.

China has long term issues‚Ä¶ starting with demographics, and they will age and go through the biggest population decline anyone has seen.

They are not in a strategically good position for long term issues and in lots of cases, are going to face them this decade. 

The west is walking away from the post ww2 order that China has been able to take advantage of. 

This is why the 5th US official has visited Taiwan and China still doesn‚Äôt do anything but slap themselves on YouTube.

There are bigger powers at hand and China is doing everything in the playbook to destroy themselves."
Western paid trolls are responsible for spreading this fake views to distract investors from investing in these nations.USA and western Europe cannot stand healthy competitions so they resort to paying cheap you tubers to spread these malicious hate entrenched news about China and Russia. The world know them now hence the new world order without them and the dollar.
"I think its not only right from a moral prespective but also from a bulding a better future perspective, if banks know that bad practices will make them go bankrupt because there will be no bail outs they will act better next time. Also hunt down and send to gulags all the CEOs and large share holders just so they dont think they can make it crash and run away because they had a backup plan."

"Who said ANYTHING about the coming great depression in China???  
You may hear things the way you'd like to hear things.   

At the center of all this, no, China will not be the new world order, as many did say. So there is that."
"China's economy will collapse, but not in days or months. The collapse will coincide with their demographic collapse. Then they will be fucked."
What is baffling to me is that 1. They're obviously going to be wrong and yet 2. They have set a ridiculously small number of days so it'll be very obvious that they're wrong very soon. You'd think that would be really risky for their reputation!
We could only hope that communist shithole collapses. So they can get out of that dictatorship.
bullshit!!!
"If they are monetarily independent, can't they just print money and call it a day?"
"China is collapsing narrative it‚Äôs all part of the western propaganda as the west see China as a rising power and need to be stopped so the west can stay on top,the west especially the USA won‚Äôt China to fail,so no competition."
"I agree with most of your views, but the last point is that the Chinese government attacked Alibaba because the capital behind it began to use the company to try to set off a credit crisis to obtain financial profits (specifically, online loans). This directly aroused the vigilance of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and immediately began to intervene. No one in China thinks that Alibaba is a high-tech company, and it can not provide many jobs as it may seems.
The Chinese government has deliberately started to remove the real estate foam and financial foam in the past few years. The Evergrande crisis and Alibaba's sanctions are just appearances. This does not mean that China's economy is ""collapsing"". It only means that China is trying to avoid the crisis. China's real high-tech companies, such as Huawei, BYD and other high-tech manufacturing enterprises, have received strong support from the Chinese government in recent years, Because manufacturing is the core of China's economy."
China‚Äòs Economy is about to collapse any day since 2000. And it will keep doing so.
Western biased Media
"Lol, when America is in debt and ruined, see how they play the information BS"
China have over 5000+ year history and survived multiple hardships. China is always well prepared and have a calculated approach and solution to everything. China know as she gets stronger the west will scream louder to attempt to destabilise China. But that won‚Äôt happen as China is smart and strong.
whatever the explanation ti's an economic cycle: after  growth there is a collapse: predicting it is a exercise that many enlightened people like to do especially concening China
All wannabe prophets üòÇ
"When people fun about any country economic problems and spreed the fake news in media, dont think that hurt the people yes, same people like you without anything to be about this crapy governments.

"No one can predict when a bubble will pop, but it will pop. The housing costs there are absolutely staggering relative to their incomes"
Very accurate and objective video. Much better than many who tell stories with a lot of animation.
"When I look at the last four decades. I see a China that consistently surprised us by doing better than expected, even doing the unimaginable. People seem oblivious to the fact that population decline is the very purpose of the one-child policy,  and was deemed necessary to improve prosperity and environmental well-being. It deviates from western dogmatic belief in population growth and policies to keep populations growing through migration. This is because the west has the ambition to rule the world. 

China thinks different, it puts its people well-being central. To create more income per capita, you actually need to create labor shortages. It is the only way to raise wages and at the same time creates a strong incentive for more automation and robotization. This allows to keep lowering fabrication costs, at the same time it creates more purchasing power creating new luxury needs, which allows to transform  the economy away from low margin production. At some point the population needs to be stabilized again, and this can be done by a royal child support.. 

It will create better working conditions and higher incomes will also allow workers to work shorter. People seem to forget that the AI revolution we are now entering will fundamentally change production and society. In this a declining population is not a bad idea. When I was young our population size was 12 million. Our (very popular) socialist government considered us over-populated, created a strong incentive for emigration (Often to Canada and Australia) and wanted to bring population down to a conservative 9 million, Others opted for 7 million, some argued 5 million would make our country completely self-reliant and create the highest well-being. 

But the neo-liberals came to power and did the opposite, to this day swarming our country with migrants. So we are now at 17-18 million and rising, we have the biggest house shortage since the war, relative more homeless than the USA and wealth of the majority has consistently gone down. Wealth has been replaced with debt, and we now have the biggest divide between rich and poor in the world. People think we are rich, because we still have cheap luxury goods from China, but of households with children, 80% live below the poverty line and live from pay check to pay check, Now rising housing and energy prices is creating havoc. We have big environmental problems from far too large and intensive mega-farms, but they want to get rid of the small farmers to use their land for more housing for even more immigrants. It is driven by EU dictates, driven by big capital lobbies. 

Now China does not need to rule the world, it does not need cheap cannon fodder, by keeping large sections of society poor and stupid. It wants to elevate all people in society. And economic models tell, this creates the most prosperous society. It is not corporate feudalism that the west keeps pursuing that is most prosperous. Without SOCIAL democracy after the WW2 the west would never have beaten the Soviet Union. It created this huge economic boom through all these small companies in well regulated free markets. (New Deal, American Dream etc.). 

Now we have corporate monopolies that create unfree markets. They no longer even want to invest without a handout from government. They live on these handouts (subsidies, fat government contracts, tax evasion and acquittal, cheap energy etc.). Foreign Parasites are sucking society dry. 95% of our companies in $ is now foreign owed. In The US only 3.5% of people is still self-employed. 80% is wage slave for big corp. We have ever more centralized production, It is private communism turning people in wage slaves with ever lesser rights. Now the WEF wants to take all possessions from workers and revive a kind of industrial plantation system. 

So do not worry about China, worry about the west. When the roof comes down, you will be happy to live in China."
"You are forgetting that GOD ALMIGHTY is in control, how long will The MOST HIGH tolerate the OPPRESSIVE, ABUSIVE, THUG, CRIMINAL, ROGUE, MAFIA type organization as the CCP regime!!!"
While I still want china to fall I have to say I did like this positive video. Well done Sir.
China is buying up the world while collapsing... interesting
"Great information! I was suspicious when Graham was being all gloomy, you explained it in a great way for an economics noob like me. Groetjes uit Belgi√´."
"The reality is the West is collapsing,due to demographic failure,immigrantion,economy recession,while China is not likely to collapse,even they do,its long after the West's collapse,They will rule the world for period of time."
I was laughing when I saw those building brow up in the video.

"If you've lived and have watched western economic experts and medias for the past 20 or so years, China will always collapse...one day!

They're going for the 0.001% chance, because eventually China will collapse maybe in a hundred or 500 years...just like every nation has fallen."
Where is Gordon Chang ? üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
"Thank you for pushing back against the tide of BS. You were doing really well until you said you believe China will go through a Japan like stagnation. Almost certainly wrong. Japan's stagnation happened because it's property bubble was large as a percentage of GDP (not as much for China) and government stimulus was spent mostly on rescuing banks and the stock market. China has a history of using government deficits on things which help the real economy to grow. You also need to consider that unlike Japan in the 80's, China still a large population of poor people waiting to enter the middle class. An incredible amount of growth potential remains.

China's growth rate will slow, as it has been since before Covid hit, but I'm confident it will remain higher than most other nations, especially the West."
Finally... I thought I was taking crazy pills with the number of people who believed china would collapse in a month.
"Sadly, its a human centipede of content; from average articles, to worse news outlets to terrible youtube ""analysis"""
"Marco I think you are on the right starting point but somehow missed the mark a little
You mentioned a very important word to describe how things are done ""forcefully""
Basically the country goes at everything as if it's waging a.campaign and bulldoze all opposition so of course it looks efficient on the outset
But if there is any downside it hits ten times as hard because of little scrutiny
China has already been spending it's way out of trouble for the last 14 yrs
After the 2008 banking crisis it embarked on a massive infrastructure project domestically with mixed results. It then wen big started doing it overseas and later those patch work of infrastructure projects are packaged as One belt one road. There is very little room for it to spend it's way out of trouble after doing it for 14 yrs on a global scale
Also in the wes there's welfare state to buffer the shock. That is almost non existent in china
Saying it would end up like Japanese style decline is the best case scenario. When Japan population started declining it's GDP p
Per capita was 25000 USD in 90s dollar and Japan has worked out a way to get other countries to do it's manufacturing for it
There is a whole industry in china of getting your money out of china as well. Look at the number of ""patriotic"" wolf warriors who buy properties in the west. They don't even practice what they preach"
Exactly what Serpentza also says in his video on this topic.
"Predicting for past 40 year's,these critics are not getting tired.
The so called experts,if China collapse,it will be a big problems to the world."
"If China isn't like America or Sri Lanka it's even less like Japan. So maybe foreseeing a similar fate needs to be unpacked in a similar manner. I suspect that the visceral ideological need to be negative on China may be undermining critical thinking here. 
Confess that my opposite need definitely impacts mine."
The way that Graham has gone from normal personal finance guy to sensationalist YouTuber selling an overpriced course is kinda sad
"1. Housing bubbles are not always the same, in 2008 the housing bubble was actually a bubble of mortgage related assets to which all banks were simultaneously heavily invested with enormous leverage. In China now is a matter of constructions' companies which will default and some people who will lose their money, it's not systemic. 2. China economy is not reliant on internal consumption, not yet at least, so closures and lockdowns don't have the same impact they have in the US. 
3. about Russia, they didn't impose capital controls, it's the stupid western sanctions that practically forbid rubles to be exchanged for euros or dollars, making the Russian currency stronger and stronger, exactly in the same way forbidding European products to flow into Russia will prompt it to produce them by itself, transforming Russia in a real superpower in 2-3 years."
"The Communist Party of China is a bureaucratic capitalist regime. Whether the economy of this regime will collapse is related to the production capacity of mainland China. Therefore, as long as the world still needs goods made in China, its economy will not collapse. If it is its national economy, it has already collapsed. Just as Li Keqiang announced in 2020, there are still 600 million people in China whose monthly income is less than 1000 yuan. This may be true, but it is not an honest expression. His real intention is to send a signal to the world's financial investors and manufacturers that they have a large and cheap labor force."

"Hi Joeri!
I like your analysis. It makes a lot of sense. In the short term, you're are probably right.
However, you did not factor in the catastrophic drought and the fact that that the West (in general) is slowly but surely moving away from Chinese products - big time.
Also, Russian style economic sanctions against China over Taiwan may be much closer than we think...
In addition, socialist type of economy is a slow death sentence to any nation that applies it.
There is ample evidence of that. 
All of this is going to have a massive effect on future Chinese trade balance, etc...

It would be very interesting if you could include these factors in your next video..."
Hydro electric damns drying up. Not producing any power. So causing them to ration power and rolling blackouts. Increased temperatures. Farming crops dying due to temperature rise.  Yeah. Totally not gonna collapse
"I‚Äôve unsubscribed from over 5 channels of creators who used to provide original content and new stick to shock horror sensationalism with their clickbait articles. 

It seems as though as soon as they plateau with subscriber growth they suddenly decide they are the chosen one to enlighten the world on all the bad and corrupt. 

Cheap and tasteless.

As for the drama about China, does anyone really believe a country that‚Äôs relies on its image of strength to influence the world, is going to let their economy collapse?

They‚Äôre still ploughing millions into eliminating covid (if the western media is correct) while the rest of the world has just accepted it. 

The 2008 crash was finally triggered when someone called in what was owed and governments didn‚Äôt intervene (any further). It was a human decision made, not a natural disaster. China would never make that decision because it would expose their weaknesses and they would no longer be considered the emerging superpower."

"Yeah. I've been in Tokyo for the past 20 years and I can totally see China following a similar path to Japan as things cool down. As much as there are big differences between the Japanese & Chinese, there are also many similarities. Just like the Chinese, the Japanese are incredibly tenacious & can put up with huge amounts of adversity. Over the past 20 years Japan has continued to slowly decline, economically & demographically, but the people keep plodding along. I can totally see China following this same trajectory, as both have declining populations and had similar economic bubble bursts after years of incredible economic growth. So, even if the going gets really tough, I'd put my money on things staying in place as China stagnates & slowly declines over the next few decades. There are some key differences between the two countries however (i.e. the Taiwan situation & the fact the one-child policy has skewed the population into a dangerous demographic imbalance - more males than females is a recipe for wars breaking out) and these could lead to unpredictable outcomes arising. However I believe things will decline but the system will remain in place - as has been the case in Tokyo with the same political party ruling the country since WW2. Chinese people will just accept their fate."

"I forget the professor's names, my apologies for this in advance:

There is a professor, at Stanford, who talks about Chinese history.  Many times throughout history China had originally been a handful of countries that become united, great economic growth happened, and then this unified China broke apart back into many countries where they stagnated.  China has repeated this over and over and over again throughout history.  The elephant in the room I think is: Has China learned from this so it stops doing it?

Someone else has talked about planned economies and how they create accelerated growth early on, but once the economy becomes too large and complex for any single person to be able to handle well the economy stagnates.  This is a cycle Russia has found itself in.  (Marco did you do a video on this?  I forget.)  In theory unless China loosens its authoritarian ways odds are high its economy will stagnate like Russia's has.

There is another professor who has talked about the stages of transition in a developing country and why so many countries fail to break into a fully developed country.  I haven't verified this but apparently all throughout history this transition period has been met with a collapse of the countries government or a great depression style scenario.  The US' version of this was the great depression.   Apparently this period can be incredibly rough.  There is a case to be made this is what China is going through or will be going through shortly.

Peter Zeihan is pretty popular for his successful predictions based on demographics.  Because of the One Child Policy shrinking the work force combined with the older generation beginning to retire this decade he expects a hard decade economically for China in the coming years.  He believes there is a social contract between the government and the people where the one party remains unchallenged as long as there is economic growth.  If economic growth dies down due to demographics this social contract is broken and the Chinese government could fall into disarray.  This overlaps historically with what has happened over and over again in China throughout history.

While I haven't been following the doomsday finance youtubers or whoever they are (except Zeihan, this channel, and some university lectures) so I can't comment on the youtuber's arguments, it does look like China is not out of the woods yet.  5 to 20 years from now there is a possibility of more unrest in China than we are seeing today.  An economic stagnation is probably the best outcome."
"If the drought, fire and floods don't do them in."
makes some good points though
I've seen two channels following this narrative and it seems bootlickish....am I alone on this? propaganda machines fighting against each other?
"Africa, M.East, Asean and some Asia country is supporting China, it not easy for China economy collapse, and they's not using US$ to trade."
gigachad china enjoyer
"China focuses more on productive assets they are stable because they produce assets need by others cheaper that other manufacturing countries. On the other hand, US that focuses on how to inflate it's assets by pure speculation unlike China fundamental economy."
Western media spreading disinformation of China economy
"China is closing itself off to the world again. Shutting down their economy is causing other countries to become more self reliant. I don't think they will get that back. Everyone is realizing how bad it is to depend on a communist country. Their own people do not even have faith in them anymore. Lowing interest rates now will most likely cause hyper inflation. I think their currency will be about as valuable as my butt hairs ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
That doesn't even take into account the actual cost of their industrialization. Toxic ground, toxic water, rampant poverty, droughts, low birthrates, aging population, tofu dregs, instability in the party, and many other things. I think China is already a failed state. And if they attack Taiwan, they will lose what little they have left."
"For the past 3 months more and more video are been made on the collapse of the PRC, at first I thought it was a joke, but soon it all make sense that it is not whether or not China will collapse, its more about China haters hope that everything China is experiencing right now will lead to the collapse. Kind of like wishful thinking!"
"Feels like a lot of people are rooting for China to collapse. It's sad. I also don't agree with China's actions to some extent, but I would never wish an economic collapse to happen to millions of people. Heck I also don't agree with some of the US' actions, but I would never wish their economy to collapse."

I never understood how anyone could have claimed that.. It seems nonsensual to me that a countries who produces literally everything would collapse anytime soon.
"sorry to say, but you are only assuming that they won't collapse just based on a few metrics (RE) without counting others and the domino effect of that. It's more complicated than chicken and egg problem that their government can deal with after intervention.

RE in China is related to the local government. There are 33 cities in China that has the same level of debt like Detroit before their default. In terms of nominal debt and ratio to income. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Any government intervention to the RE market in China won't work unlike in US due to fundamental issue, Demand. Do you want to live in China? Yea, exactly. Not only that, you have to know that in China, you can have a mortgage when the construction hasn't started yet. It means if the developers stop the construction, you still have to pay the mortgage even though you can't use the house for a place to live. The majority of the housing bubble is in apartment project, where not all units in that project are already sold to the actual buyers. But many are still empty. The empty units are built by the mortgage of a small fraction of actual buyers of that housing projects. The developers speculate in this manner in all projects. e.g. 1 building construction project with 100 units is started by the mortgage of just 10 people and the completion of the building project will be up to the sales performance during the construction. It's highly risky and highly speculative, far more than US housing bubble. That's why there are so many ""skeleton buildings"" where they're not just empty but also unfinished. Not enough buyers to continue the construction. In US housing bubble, you still have the property to be used as most of the properties are single family housing that you can sell piece by piece easily. In China, you have to complete the building first to continue selling it and using it as an actual house. otherwise no one will buy it. Chinese RE is already on a deadlock just by this situation alone.

There are serious housing oversupply, because they altered their demographic data in 3 censuses. As a window dressing to the macro economic data on aging population back in the late 1990s. The local government and property developers are using this same data to make housing projects. In results, they're building houses for a non existent demographic. From 1 age group alone, it was inflated around 18 million people in the late 1990s census.

 Since we know RE is tied to the local government income, poor selling RE project means no local government income. No local government income means there will be local government bonds crisis in near future. Beaides that, those mortgage is issued by local SOE banks, there's on going crisis of liquidity in many local banks. Since more than 50% of local banks portfolio is tied to the RE. Not just the mortgage but also credits to the suppliers and construction company and developers. In 1 region, their portfolio is 90% tied to theb RE. Locals can't pay their mortgage and won't pay their mortgage if the construction doesn't continue. The developers can't continue the construction because there's not enough money and buyers to continue those projects. Banks can't let people to withdraw their money because no one is paying their mortgage and RE related debts. Government intervention won't solve this fundamental crisis. Unless if they want to bear the losses of oversupply and organize the buyers.

That's just half of the ptoblem, we haven't talked about the suppliers problem and its multiplier effects. Chinese steel industry before the pandemic is 30% idle, that's why they have Belt Road Initiative so their steel is used abroad on Chinese projects. now it's more than 50% idle due to the pandemics and RE crisis. Not just that, there's oversupply of Chinese steel in China. Cement industry will suffer the same fate. Same will happen to the Glass industry and building materials industry. In every economic crisis, there will be a banking crisis behind that besides the unemployment crisis. Do you know the 4 biggest banks in China? 2 of them are China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial bank of China. That's right, you can guess which industry is their main specialty. Not just that, they're systematically important banks in China. It means if those 2 collapse, China will collapse financially. Chinese GDP is fueled by RE industry and manufacturing by FDI. Now the FDI is gone (they're on negative FDI since even before the pandemic) and the RE is crumbling. Keynesian economy won't solve this because at the end of the day, you can't print up too much money and debt since artificial (hyper)inflation will catch up with it. No one wants to have Chinese Yuan either as a reserve currency, because it's highly regulated by the Chinese Central Bank. even CCP officials don't want it in their corruption money pool accounts. 

Last but not least, every economic growth is based on its demographic structure of that country. They're aging fast, faster than Japan during Japanese post war glorious days and they aren't free from the middle income trap unlike Japan and SK.  Even their middle income part of their country is not free from the middle income trap. What does it mean? Social welfare crisis and insurance crisis. Not enough young people to pay for them. Not only that, those younger generation will be the sandwich generation. They have to work at least 3 times harder to cope with it and preserve the lifestyle and standard of living. 1 is for themselves, 1 for their parents and 1 for their kids (if they have kids, but probably not due to the cost).

Not every crisis can be solved with government intervention especially if their fundamental is flawed and can't be fixed. When you have banking liquidity crisis, housing crisis, local government debt crisis and industrial debt crisis, I don't think there's an easy way out of that without social reprisal and massive social unrest to their government. As we know in Chinese history, there's always power struggle during a massive social unrest. From 3 kingdoms era, Mongol dynasty, Manchu dynasty to the warlords era. If that happens, you know China is collapsing."
Whether china collapses or not is very difficult to predict as we are only mortals. However everyone is entitled to their opinion. We hear and we decide ourselves.

"With due respect, I feel so sorry for you.  Why is there a need to entertain these 'experts', talking heads, reporters', etc.  We will know in time to come.  

Perhaps, just produce a name list of this talking heads, experts, advisors, reporters, etc and list the key point that they mentioned (e.g. collapse in 29 days (the date it is occur).  Then, monitor the outdone.

In future, they make other such type statements; you attached the list as rebuttal and caution the readers.  Likewise, attached links of data or truth as comment to their original write-up or clips for readers to be enlighten (with just short commentaries).  This approach I think I think is more effective.

Another possible approach is to request such autherstl yo provide proof and data (please, not another talking head opinion or commentary as you and I can pretend to be experts, etc.  Cold hard data/facts). 

I can assure you after you request a few times and they cannot provide, they will block you for asking them to substantiate their claims with data or proof.

There are too many ignorant readers around spreading such nonsense.

Just keep it short and simple, please provide documentary proof/data to substantiate.  In this particular case, we will revisit after 29 days. PERIOD."
most of the view from those video are from indian who wish China can slow down one notch and not make them look so bad
"I think you might want to brush up on your probabilities. A double anything has the same probability. It doesn't matter if it's 6,5,4 3,2,or1 probabilities of number sums, however are very different.

"Sorry but China is in serious trouble.

You have to admit though ‚ÄúChina collapsing in 25 days‚Äù gets a lot more clicks than boring truth.

"The Chinese government controls everything. The American government controls nothing, treating economics like the weather while China seeks to control their economy like the weather ‚Ä¶ not perfect but at least they try unlike coming up with excuses as they do in the West."
While I agree with you... I wish there was a way that the CCP could go away without either a global depressions and or WW3. The human rights crisis in China far out weighs the other issues you mentioned and I regard it as criminal what the west's companies have done in cooperating with the CCP's human rights abuses. The CCP is worse than the Nazi party ever was and no one is standing up to them: the world is enabling them and even cheering them on.

OMG MY sister called me almost in tears because she saw a tic tok or something and I had to talk her off a ledge. Wish I had seen this video first.
Those you tuber look do stupid when China did not collapse on the date they predicted.
China's economy is kpt going to collapse until the people who created and control the CCP say so
"I never really thought that China would collapse economically, mainly because the government controls just about everything there.    But I think the Chinese economy can and will be severely damaged, and I question how well it is going to be able to rebound as more and more companies are relocating or adding factories in other countries because of supply disruptions due to the shipping backlog and Covid shutdowns.      

When things finally stabilize, are manufacturing concerns in other countries who moved out of China by necessity, and started buying parts from Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico, etc. going to go back to the way it was before when (if) there are no more Covid shutdowns and the backlog is fixed?      Some will return, but not all, or even most.      China is going to face the same issue as Russia when the Ukraine war eventually ends, and the sanctions are lifted.      Germany, etc. is not going to go back to the way things were before, even with Russia offering cheaper prices.     Yes, Germany will buy some Russian gas because it is cheaper and the pipeline is already there, but it is not going to go back to the same level of dependency as before.     Same IMO with the parts supply manufacturers who moved and will move out of China."
"All youtube videos on this subject should be taken with a grain of salt.  Including this one.  Opinions are like buttholes, everybody has one."
How do you explain the Chinese who bought land and homes in other countries if money isn't allowed to leave China?
"""China will be absolutely fine because they can just print more money"" that's sound economic insight.  Printing more money just dilutes the value and even if you couldn't take your money out of China (which you can its called Macau) I'm sure you can still by gold and other commodities. Things where their value are not under Chinese control"
China will collapse its only a matter of time China does not have the ability to issue its own currency without repercussions the USA can but not China for the past 2 decades chinas gdp has been based on debt China is seeing not just capital flight but manufacturing flight as well as the USA and Europe are looking to leave China along with Japan South Korea and Australia countries are done with China and without manufacturing China WILL die and collapse not trying to hurt anyones feelings but it‚Äôs true stop living in denial

You put out quality content. I like how you break down complex topics in very digestible explanations. More people should be watching your content because so many people like to sh*t on economics as a discipline.
"With the inflation and how the current money supply is created by demand rather than economical growth, I think we need to talk about this question at a more fundimental level. Namely, what constitutes stagflation or economic collapse. If we go by the traditional sense of GDP measurement where services have the same weight as production is that real growth? A good example would be Amber Heard trial where lawyers and expert witnesses on both sides properly made close to a million in total. Is it fair to say the USA economy grow by a million from that trial? Also let's say China's export collapsed, as it is increasingly likely due to a collapse of the Europe economy, but China's production compacity remains the same, is that an economic collapse? Similar to Japan China's GDP would drop but the stander of living would remain the same or more likely increase due to more goods becoming cheaper in the domestic market."
I sure hope you're wrong.
"Yup. Everyone loves to hate on China, as if they haven't done better than most developed nations consistenly for decades. Even when they do fiinally have issues, they will figure it out. You can hate the CCP all you want, but acting like China is about to collapse is ridiculous."
Incredible explanation!

"So, again, a country gets out of a crisis caused by printing too much money and creating too much debt by printing more money and creating more debt.  At the same time private investment in China is shrinking and public investment has proved misplaced.  And thirdly, China now has an aging and shrinking population which means domestic demand will shrink."
"Like Wolf of Wallstreet says, no one know whether economy is going up down or sideways. In any case, China has a large surplus that will stabilize the economy like that of Japan."
"China imports 70% of food anda out 80% of energy, and they pay for these with USD the global currency. They currently have a swine flu outbreak will will destroy their pork production, increasing imports (pork is the primary source of protein in China). Diluting the value of the YUAN by printing will work internally and will make it even harder to import Food, Fuel, Iron ore, bauxitre, copper, zinc, etc as all of these are paid for in the Global Currency USD. As the Fed keeps increasing interest rates then the USD gets stronger, more money gets sucked into the US financial system as there is a better yield. This dollar shortage and strengthening will make it much harder for China to get these imports. The rolling lockdowns are destroying their manufacturing reputation, to repair supply chains most companies are moving their manufacturing out of China. This won‚Äôt end well."
"hitting a 2x 6 is statistically just as probable as 2x 5, 2x 4 or a 2x 3. No?"
"A very calm and reasoned analysis of China's situation.  However, it seems like some degree of sensationalism is in order since your most probable scenario forecasts a long, slow decline of China's economic power.  In other words, we are now seeing peak China and this is as big and powerful economically as it's going to get.  That's big news."
"Debunking American propaganda? Be careful, that can be dangerous."
Thank you! I was trying to understand China and their economy. I watched alternative videos and whole they had se interesting points the titles and hypothesis felt they were for clickbait. This seems logical
China economy collapse world is gona collapse
"You would think an economist knows that landing the dice hard ways (double numbers) is a 1:36 chance. 1 possible way to roll the intended result and 36 ways the dice can possible roll (6 faces of one die multiplied by 6 faces of the other die). All craps players know this... So, the likelihood of rolling double 2's, double 6's or even double 1's is exactly the same."
I agree but I hope they'll roll double sixes just for the sake of all of us
"The world is getting better manufacturing options than China. Vietnam. Vietnam US relations are sobering, and investment is flourishing. Example: Apple. Mexico. Mexico is becoming a good alternative for automobile manufacturing as labor is getting cheaper and transportation is less costly and more reliable, especially with these forced port closures from China. Example: General motors. 

China is done. Not in 30 days, but in 30 months perhaps. Japan stagnation perhaps, but post-bubble Japan then. It will get nasty, but slowly."
"As far as I know, the wealth of China has only been possible because the rich world let them become the production hub for the world and increasingly erratic China a lot of that production will be moved to more safe and friendly places and the CCP has as done something that has always led to a total breakdown when it has been implemented and that is the process of taking away incentives for the people. So, where Japan was able to get back due to the openness of the economy China might end up more like Argentina in recent times and Venice in the old days. So, the collapse will more likely take 29 years and not 29 days."
"Amazing video as always. I was already weary of those videos in my recommened. For years already ""experts"" have been predicting the collapse of China and its always a couple of weeks away.

But what I find interesting is that you think China will most likely end up stagnating like Japan. Can this really happen? I had the impression that Japans bubble was way larger in relation. Does that mean China will likely not surpass the US?

Speaking of Japan, what are your thoughts on the current rising inflation rate of Japan?"
"Marco, it is very simple. Doom stories sell better."
These are sadists who wishes the worst for others and despicable as they are paid to do that.
"Actually China switched to 3-child policy 2 years ago (New to you eh)
Overall, nice vid"
"Getting two 6s has a probability of a bit under 2.8% which, while small, is uncomfortably high considering the highly damaging nature of that scenario. I'm actually surprised you gave this scenario over 1% chance considering what you said earlier in the video. (Disclaimer: I don't know whether this probability is too low or high; I was just surprised at your assessment at the end because I expected a lower probability.)"
"The issue is one of degree. They are well beyond diminishing returns in infrastructure spending so more debt fueled spending will be akin to pushing on a rope. In addition, the general public has recognisized the chinese lroperty market as a ponzi scheme. As such, unlike in the past, the second leg of the economic stool has been kicked out from underneath them. Finally, Their manufacturing sector could easily be derailed by the looming energy and supply chain crisis. Next, they will be burdened by a looming demographic meltdown that they simply cannot stem.

Net, net....THEY ARE TOAST. Either now or i n the not too distant future.

This was a very superficial propaganda peice funded by the CCP. Get a clue, dude."
"Monetary independence and global production by full capital control are the opposite of capitalism. Great succession was a result of capitalism. As long as China continues to not letting capital to supersede political control and stability, China‚Äôs internal economic path will not be a great succession as in the US in the foreseeable future."
"Thank you for shedding light on this not-so-well-understood topic.  I agree with you on the conclusion (before the dice thing) and I think Ray Dalio would agree too, at least most of the time. This if China succeeds in maintaining the geopolitical pressure and growing presence it wants while avoiding a cold war or - god forbid - open war.

I much enjoy your videos, thanks for all this insight and knowledge sharing."
"China is strong enough to take a hit like this, westerns won't admite it"
ahhh Youtube....the go to place for global economic guidance üòÇü§£üòÖ
I think you are giving way too much credit to the Chinese power holders and ignoring the stupidity of their policies
How much is the CCP paying you?
They got paid
"Wow, I voted for this content now here it is!! This channel has such great and thoughtful content. Thank you Money & Macro !"
"Exact!!! The Chinese state has come to have monetary control (M1) and take that privilege away from private banking (M2). With that you will be able to print all the money needed to plug the holes left by the fractional reserve system. And with the large dollar reserves, you will be able to have control of the appropriate exchange rate (according to the Peruvian model of exchange stability) and according to the experience of North American QE (before the pandemic) as long as that newly printed M1 money does not circulate in the streets and only stay in the banks or invested in properties, it will not produce inflation. The sovereignty of its monetary policy and the state direction of its capitalism is the key, including the power it has over its oligarchs like Jack Ma who separated it from its own company when it pretended to play the stock market, while it supports other entrepreneurs in high technology so that they become the first in the world."
"Exacto!!! El Estado chino a pasado a tener  el control  monetario (M1) y quitarle ese privilegio a la banca privada (M2). Con eso podr√° imprimir todo el dinero necesario para tapar los huecos dejados por el sistema de reserva fraccional. Y con las abultadas reservas de dolares, podr√° tener un control del tipo de cambio adecuado (seg√∫n el modelo peruano de estabilidad cambiaria) y seg√∫n la exoeriencia de los QE norteamericanos (antes de la pandemia) mientras ese dinero recien impreso M1 no circule en las calles y solo se quede en los bancos o invertidos em propiedades, no producir√° inflaci√≥n. La soberan√≠a de su pol√≠tica monetaria y la direccion estatal de su capitalismo, es la clave, incluyendo el poder que tiene sobre sus oligarcas como Jack Ma que lo separaron de su propia empresa cuando pretendi√≥ jugar a la bolsa, mientras que apoya a otros empresarios de alta tecnolog√≠a para que se conviertan en los primeros en el mundo."
Those doomsday videos never made any sense to me. And all these guys lose credibility when they don‚Äôt exercise proper due diligence in their analysis. But what do u expect of YouTubers that stretch 2 talking points into 15 mins .
Yeah but it is having a demographic  collapse and it is going to be in big trouble by the end of this decade.
"Its amazing...one person that can predict the future.
Bwhahahahahaha.
Fool."
My hypothesis was not collapse but a decade of slow slow growth and painful for all the tech companies which the Huawei president has said
I think what you're missing here is the trillions of dollars of local authority debt and the fact that the Chinese property market is a massive Ponzi scheme.
"The world will throw less demand for Chinese manufactured goods.

China will 'hurt' badly to some level..."
I think you are spot on.
Seems to me like letting finance capitalism dominate an economy might be unwise.  Call me crazy ;)
Nobody serious is comparing China to Sri Lanka. A fairer and better video would have compared China to Japan and the other Asian economies that crashed in the 90s
"@6:59, 
Hmmm‚Ä¶no it hasn‚Äôt. China is dependent on outside investment to pay its debts."
"No, China will not become like Japan. The Japanese are satisfied with being nr.2, how are they even comparable to the Chinese?"
Thank you for putting those crazy stories to rest. God bless you and hope you stay safe during this crazy time.
je krijgt die chinezen niet zomaar klein.
"American right wing economists just can‚Äôt understand chinas economy, or acknowledge its achievements (however terrible and corrupt their government system might be.)"
"Those guys are called ""Youtube Financial Entertainers"" üòÜ"
Collapse is a strong word.
You forgot to mention that China stole all the money from their state owned banks. Then changed everyones covid statuses to prevent them from travelling to protest. They won't run out of money. They just steal from their citizens.
"Not in days. But they are screwed, no doubt about it."
"If a seemingly intelligent person uses the word COLLAPSE so flippantly, do not trust them. If they don't know what a collapse is, they probably don't know much else."
"China is not like Japan, their GDP per capita and average income is still well below develop countries, which means they still have a lot of growth left. They've already switched from the one child policy to two child policy ten years ago. Their population hasn't stopped growing."
It is the order of magnitude!!  When 70% of savings is tied up in the largest ponzi scheme in history.  Avg of  25 times annual income is the cost of a house vs 4-6 times in the US.   25% of houses are empty and then 30% of their economy is tied up in housing construction.  Now add in COVID and shut down of industry.  Now add huge food shortage due to drought.  Now add to massive bank failures and fraud.
Haha. Seeing you on Beijing's ruins in 27 days!
the most cringe thing about the thumbnails is the day count. just wtf?
I wish you would not delete this video when China will have collapsed.
A Japan style scenario is unlikely as this only happened through the Plaza Accord. China's economy is already strong enough to resist it. Not to mention that property only accounts for a small percentage of China's GDP. And you forget that there are other markets besides the western ones that are far bigger.
well not for you to decide.
"You're kind of overlooking the fall in Chinese industrial output due to the lockdowns, China needs the world to buy there cheap crap on a good day imagine on this scenario.

The days of the Chinese Miracle are over , from now on it'll be a steep decline... what impact will this have on the CCP is unknown but its not gonna be pretty"
"The ""China is doomed"" drivel is a propaganda campaign.
While all countries are currently facing challenges, China is in the best position manage it's challenges.
Clowns have been predicting China's collapse for decades while China has continued to prosper famously despite all that noise."
Do you not think that economic stagnation would be just as dangerous for social stability then a full collapse?
"Getting the pair of 6 and 6 on a throw of two fair dice is exactly as probable as getting (5, 5), (4,4) or (3,3): exactly 1/36 each. (Getting the _sum_ of 5+5=10 or 4+4=8 is more probable than getting 12: you can get 12 and 2 in only one of 36 possible ways, they are the lowest probable.)That's a little bit too much of the second-degree ignorance (ignorant _and_ confident from being ignorant of own ignorance) from someone talking as a macroeconomist ‚Äúassigning probabilities‚Äù to possible scenarios. As for ""post your answer below,"" the probability of getting any other pair but (6,6), (5,5), (4,4) or (3,3) in one throw is exactly 32/36, or 8/9. There you have your perfectly correct and as perfectly useless answer as one usually gets from a mathematician.

I don't understand a sliver of macroeconomics, and am thankful for your little probability puzzle. It's important to know whom to not listen to, even more so than to know whom to do. Nothing personal, please, but put yourself in my shoes. Your statement X: macroeconomic is about assigning probabilities to scenarios. Fact: you don't understand probabilities at the most basic level imaginable. If X is true, then you certainly cannot do macroeconomics for the lack of the necessary grasp on probabilities. If X is false, my Bayesian posterior probability of your other statements also being false is strongly bumped by this falsity. And sure, I had brain farts in public and on record too, but nothing close to this fundamentally ‚Äúnot even wrong,‚Äù in Pauil's snappy words, weirdly ridiculous statement."
It will collapse soon. No worries.
Great Content as always
"The property problem is more difficult, dont know how they gonna get out of that."
I agree!
America print more money to support their addiction. Will destroy from within just like the Roman Empire
America economy will collapse first
"Macroeconomics doesn't factor in microeconomics  It's the very reason Xi will not be able to get any effective solutions across. There will be tremendous human suffering to achieve his policies, and many young Chinese will lose faith in China politically. The current policy solutions are also macro in nature, which will never ""trickle down"" to the average person nor inspire the morale needed to get the economy back on track."
"Good vid,
""monetary independence"" is key here, you are right.

But, there some more risk here to consider, I would add.
A deglobalisation trend, where more goods are produced locally, means not in China. This could reduce the trade surplus of China. Not in 25 days though, but over the next 5 to 10 years, could be a serious threat.
The rapidly decline of the working population in China could reduce of the ""China factory"" of which a greater share is consumed domestically, because the retirees are still there and in a growing number. So less goods to export elsewhere.
Third capital controls work only so far. If the pressure get to high, capital will find ways somehow to exit the country. It is like a steam boiler, when the pressure gets to high, well the steam wont stay contained to the boiler
anymore. Especially if foreigners start pulling capital out in great numbers.
Ok this would not happen also in next 25 days.
The biggest risk for now for China is consumer confidence, the trust of Chinese people in their government, in the economic miracle of China. They had 40 years of marvelous growth. Still a lot of Chinese people expect, that this will continue for while. 
But if a ""lay flat"" movement spreads, Chinese people dont buy properties, dont buy stocks, dont consume exept for absolut daily nessecities, well than the economy would stop to grow.
This could eventually cause some trouble for the government.
But still, the Chinese government has plenty of ace'ses in their sleeves to manipulate the economy.
On the other hand, I think a ""Japanese scenario"" is unlikely, imao.
The Japanese had no capital controls, huge wealth accumulated outside the country, and their industries were, and still are, more competitive. The benefit of beeing a more free society/democracy.
So China will likely collapse in a big bang, not like Japan a death by tausend cuts over 40 years.
But not in the next 25 days, but in the next 5-10 years for sure, imao."
"You argue from the beginning that China is not like the U.S.  But why only focus on the how it would be better side?  It could also be worse.  Why couldn't China have a Great Depression like the U.S., except from different mechanics?  Also, you focus too much on monetary policy.  Neither Yuan nor Dollars feed people.  China has a huge farming problem (complex), energy and infrastructure bad decision making.  I don't see China collapsing in the near future.  But I don't see them going the way of Japan either, for complex reasons you're probably well aware. In short, I buy your conclusion but not all of your argument because it's too monetary focused ;)"
"I love your channel. You give the truth to people without overexaggerating. I don't know why people keep thinking China will collapse, but I never for a second believed that. There is such a thing as ""too big to fail"". As much as I don't agree with a lot of things the Chinese government does, China isn't going anywhere."
"Thanks. Was getting so tired of these armchair goons who have no idea what they're rambling on about. I think the stagnation scenario you outline is quite probable, but I give a low growth scenario a slightly higher probability. By low growth, I mean by China's standards, so let's say a rolling average of 2-3%. While that is troublesome for China, especially in a nation where single party rule derives much of its legitimacy from aggressive economic growth, and in which the economy and politics are highly intertwined, it is a far cry from ""COLLAPSE, bruv!"" Even the scenario of stagnation you see as most likely, by which I assume you mean between 1-2% growth as seen in Japan, while potentially very bad for China, is not a doomsday scenario. However, I do see stagnation for China being even more difficult than it was (and has been) for Japan, as Japan was much further along its economic growth/development curve before it hit that stagnation phase. 
Another great video, keep up the awesome work!"
"You're so smart, thqt I can smell the toxic eye rolling you give people when they don't agree with you.

https://youtu.be/v9W6On6IocE"
"All great points. The flip side, I think, is that political stability in China over the past 30 years has been based on annual growth of about 10%. What happens when growth falls to 3 or 4% in a system that is so unequal and has no democratic safety valves (meaning, nobody honest to complain to about pollution, traffic, etc)? Sure seems like the leadership understands this and that's why they've been cracking down on any ""excess"" freedom, and installing tons of surveillance, in Hong Kong, in the marketplace, online. The leadership is expecting rough seas, I think it's obvious. Could be messy."
"A Japan-style stagnation is only possible if China could escape the middle income trap. At the rate things are going, they might not be able to..."
hey man goede video. het is mischien wel een idee om te investeren in een iets betere microfoon. gewoon een tip
"Say hi to your Chinese friends, sellout."
"Great. Like the different scenario you describe, as opposed to a lot of others. You cover the financial side, but I'm wondering if the population decline, China's dependence on trade, do make for a pretty rapid decline."
Lol China central bank can afford it. They all lost their life savings. No power no water. Yep their going good.
Laowhy86 did this video a week ago.
I think China's economy will keep growing every year but just not as fast.
I think these projections stem from the interesting yet incredibly hyperbolic Peter Zeihan.
"No sensationalism, just pure rationale. You're the hero that we need in times of confusion, thanks a bunch!"
"One not economic part of the crisis is that the abuse of covid apps to prevent people from protesting has eroded trust of Chinese citizens in the state.

Anyway: thank you for shedding light on other scenarios ‚Äî those ‚ÄúChina is going down‚Äù scenarios had begun to get annoying and monotone, though they always used other angles to look at the same scenario."
You forgot inflation!
You have to love people with integrity. But I don't think its japan style stagnation either. Since China has full sovereignty and not a puppet government by the US. So China is able to challenge the US for the high margin high-tech industries as what is happening right now. This will benefit all humans on earth since competition promotes innovation.
These anti china video are flood like flies. it's all about jealousy
Finance YouTube reminds me of my uncle that has correctly predicted 25 of the last four economic crises
Awesome video. You're an inspiration.
Let's call it the great japanification and be done with it! Also great video.
"One problem... in 2008 Foreclosures helped to mitigate the loses on the revenue streams - Securities were still garbage - but at least you can recover some of the loss when you grab the asset... But with Evergarde - If they haven't built them - WTF will the bank recover when Mr and Mrs Yuan say ""No more Mortgage Payment"" THERE IS NO ASSET TO REPOSSES. Then add in Chinese Shadow banking rather than deposit derivative banking - this will be catastrophic."
Has North Korea collapsed? they will not collapse they will just become more tyrannical.
I know that feeling buddy. These losers keep adding days that their imaginary collaspe that wouldn't happen.
"hello thanks for your video, do you think banking sector bail out and/or fiscal stimulus could be a serious inflation risk in us and europe? could it exacerbate the reckless lending practices and simply kick the can down the road for a worse debt crisis in the future? 

also what is a likely range long term growth expectation in a stagnation scenario like you described? 2% real gdp? or lower?"
Commenting for algorithm so people will actually know that the CCP isn't gonna go away any time soon.
No matter how much I put not recommended for those click baits. YouTube doesn't listen.
Am I missing something? Isn't the probability of throwing a double 4 exactly the same as throwing a double 6?
"The Chinese economy might well be in trouble and it may affect the rest of the world, but the idea it will collapse in the sense that China will fall into chaos is far fetched. The authorities would rather slaughter most of its own population than allow anarchy."
"@3:19: ""Through witty, irrelevant and informative reporting..."" The word you were looking for is ""irreverent""."
even though you seem to be the only person saying it wont collapse Im still gonna trust you over the others because you actually link your sources in the descirption
"Well, those idiots that predicted the collapse of China‚Äôs economy in coming days just wanted to be another Gordon Chang."
"All I see are China collapse for the last 2 years, and China is still here! I wonder how much grant do these YouTuber get!?"
"I think a double three is just as likely as a double six, but that's just the way I roll."
"I loved your video, but it seems like your issue is entirely with picking a time frame.  Because the ""collapse"" part you lay out is pretty much exactly the same as every sensationalist presenter you are calling out here.

I'm sure there are some calling for rampant cannibalism and pogroms in the streets, and I agree those are pretty much non-starters  (Well beyond a triple-6, much less a double-6!).  I don't see any kind of violent Chinese Civil War coming in any realistic time frame.  But almost every book I've read or video I've seen here on YouTube agrees that they are facing a sharp economic decline in the near future.  Everyone, including you, apparently agrees that their techniques to extend ""stability"" have limits.

Just because the CCP values ""stability and growth"" over profits doesn't mean they have different tools available.  They have the same monetary and trade tools everyone else does.  They cannot apply their internal tools to international trade and eventually they will run out of foreign money to cover their weaknesses.  It may take a few years, not weeks, but things like the volume of manufacturing moving out of China right now will weaken their main international strength over time, hastening the time when it becomes unsustainable."
Wishful thinking says they'll fall apart.
I hope this ages well for you
The funny thing is that I saw those videos and I did not click on any of them. Then I clicked on this one. The truth is that I regularly work with China and their way of realizing projects is highly convincing. I think we should learn a couple of things from them as westerners...
"Thank goodness!!! Finally, you have made it clear!!! Well done!"
"Seems like the people running those Chinese ""news"" channels are certain people who want to be able to steamroll the Chinese people's sovereignty and loot their nation like they did in the West."
"I don't know Macro, let's see in..*checks calendar* 22 days"
"This analysis focuses on macro-economy. But what abou,t overlooked in ours days, political economy? China is ruled by the Communists, they can go beyond Japan-like limitations and restructure property system. In other words, to abandon Leninist ""new economic policy"" (NEP, look it up)) and switch gear to more Socialism."
"It is hard for China's economy to collapse because of the Chinese government's long-term vision, the Chinese people's strong character, hardworking spirit, and the desire to not repeat the colonial past."
Thought something was fishy when I googeled it and could find nothing of the sort from any reputable news-outlet
you got an insta sub the minute i saw the title. im so tired of ppl claiming china is collapsing. thank you for bringing some sense to the conversation
Very nice video
If their economy collapsed they only have to harvest more organs and become rich againüòÇ
Great video
"i don't think it's going to collapse, but its still gonna be a pretty tough decade for china economically, and could potentially crumble if mismanagement continues

either way, get me a quarter on midnight, one can always hope XD"

"Oh bro...sooo a Russian allied +  overleveraged + export dependent economy is going to do just fine in a post-covid deglobalized economic environment added to a geopolitical confrontation between himself and his major ally against his main trade partners?

China is about to fall in a bigger version of the trap used to trip up the Japanese economy back in the 80s and 90s...and China is running full speed towards it. It might take a few years, it might not look like a collapse initially, but that economy is about to get a dose of the ugliest reality. üçøüçø"
Great video.  Thanks for calling out other YTers fanaticism.
Awesome video and I appreciate the honesty. I've been getting these doom & gloom videos from other econ/politics youtubers on my recommendations and it's just so tiresome to hear this very basic arguments of how China's done and what not.
"I have also seen a lot of the posts you are referring to. Most of them have a very small number of subscribers/views. My guess is that posts like the ones you are describing are ""click bait"" and are sensationalist in nature to try and drive up enthusiasm for the site. Most of them either borrow or steal from each other and more successful YouTube sites, both stats and video. I don't know of anyone who seriously follows Chinese interests that is taken in by these posts.

That being said, I believe China's best days are behind it. The real estate and financial sectors are only two pieces of the puzzle. Even before COVID (and, worse, the 'Zero COVID' policy) China's manufacturing costs were rising to the extent that foreign manufacturing interests were looking to offshore and seek better options elsewhere. Add to the mix a demographic decline that is a slow-moving train wreck, and it is not unreasonable to think that within the next decade or so we may see China dissolve much like the Soviet Union did in 1990."
"Good content, but you need a new mic"
The truth is China's gov can absorb problems that would cripple any other country - life has no value . But there will be problems but to what extent ... that is the question.
"So I enjoy your videos - much more than other youtube ""finance wonks"", because you very much shoot straight most of the time. However, I think you've glossed over some pretty important considerations that might make the ""japan style"" collapse less of a certainty, and the ""total tailspin"" more of a possibility. 

Capital Flight:  FDI is at the heart of chinese manufacturing; Apple, Tesla, Samsung, etc. moved their factories over to China, and own those factories. This made sense when the cost of labor and materials is low, and that's the main way that China became the workshop of the world. However, Chinese salaries have increased steadily over the past decade (which is how they're getting a middle class) and Zero-Covid policies continues to disrupt supply chains, which take months to shake out. This, combined with the renegotiation of NAFTA into NAFTA II: Electric boogaloo means that within your capital flight is foreign investment moving nations; for example when Samsung moves a factory from Shanghai to Vietnam, or a Kia plant comes to Georgia, that factory doesn't come back, ever. It's gone, it's shuttered, it's moved on, and even if China nationalizes the old plant, they're now competing against the name-brand that's getting the work done elsewhere, which is going to open them up to a host of protectionist lawsuits in their target markets. This flight of not just capital but *investment* permanently depresses your ability to be competitive as a manufacturing base globally. It's much more of a lagging indicator, but it's still a permanent move down. 

Debt Addiction: China is the most hyper-financed country in both real and actual terms. When the Asian Financial Crisis hit in the 90's, most nations had a choice: Total collapse (of which some countries just never recovered, even to today) or a long, drawn out scream (such as Japan's permanent ...whatever is going on over there. It's sure not growth.) China barely noticed the bump because it just wallpapered over the problem with more cash, and repeated that during 2008; it's construction sector saw a massive increase in orders and megaprojects as China ""New Deal""ed it's way out of a depression. Kudos to them for that, but the debt only works when the cash comes in, and point #1 + COVID + NAFTAII is starting to take away their #1 buyer. If you also look elsewhere, to the EU and the rest of the Pacific, nations are starting to diversify supply chains *in general* to avoid any bottlenecks. So even if a country or coalition has favorable ties with China, they're not going to do the same volume of business with them if only to guarantee supply to their own domestic markets. This too is a headwind, and a permanent move down. Speaking of -

Overweight Construction: I'll ignore the shadow-banking problem China does absolutely have, and instead we'll just talk in real terms. One of the interesting theories for the ""debt diplomacy"" mega projects that China is funding in Africa and beyond isn't so much as to get nations beholden to them, but instead to give their major construction firms something to *do*. China has overbuilt it's rail systems, it's overbuilt it's housing (notoriously), it's overbuilt so much that they're too saturated for more infrastructure - but culling that sector of the economy causes a recession, which is untenable from the CCP governance point of view. By exporting their infrastructure projects and giving such tight terms the (1) make sure that chinese nationals work on the projects, keeping overall employment high, (2) finance them with debt that's collateralized by the project or other means, thereby pushing off the risk as well. It's a way to continue the dance, because the music's stopped at home. Since megaprojects have stopped abroad, the music is finally over and done, and now the debts are being called. When construction, overall, is something like 30% of your GDP and you face any form of contraction there - say even a 5% total contraction - that ripples out to secondary and tertiary industries, and the whole system shakes. If you believe the debt numbers, it's already bad. If you assume that shadow-banking is something along the lines of 40% of the volume of chinese lending *anyway*, it gets catastrophic.

Last one, I promise! Sorry for the book, y'all. 

One Child, No Consumption: China has a massive internal market, but they've never been able to make it a self-sustaining engine of consumer growth. With one child playing out over multiple generations, you end up with a 4-2-1 family tree: 4 grandparents, 2 parents, 1 child. A majority of Chinese citizens are already over the age of 50; if China starts to have economic problems writ large, they're not going to be able to consume their way out of it, and they're not going to be able to tax their way out of it. Yes, they can aggressively print money, but as we all know that's horrifically inflationary if you're going to bail out such a large economy. 

Alright. Sorry again for the book, but I love your series and what you do, and I'd love your feedback on my thoughts as well, if you have the time."
"I mostly agree with the assessment but it all comes down to how the CCP chooses to move forward, As they have an internal power struggle going on inside the party and depending on how that ends will determine what agenda they adopt and what the intended trajectory is for China as a country. Currently under Ji they still have the Belt & Road plan with BRIX while expanding the PLA and now pushing a cultural revolution 2.0. If Ji is removed from power then all this is subject to change. There is a lot of corruption and so on so I could not speak to how as so much goes on behind closed doors over there."
"I was also watching these videos, I lived in China for over 8 years, 5 in Beijing and 3 in Guangzhou, and you are absolutely right, highly unlikely."
"You are mostly right. However, you do bypass the fact that the CCP is an incredible corrupt organisation and the local government system only creates the illusion of stability. The Chinese government is not more stable or more intelligent than its western counterparts. If they would be, it would mean techno-authoritarianism is the superior strategy."
"So basically, because China is authoritarian and Orwellian, it can control all information the people receive and consume. Therefore, China can lie and fool people to retain their trust in the banks. But... what happens when China fails to censor the truth? That‚Äôs when the collapse happens, which is more imminent than this Ph.D economist believes"
"The Chinese economy is MASSIVE and very diverse and this might come as a shocker but...DECENTRALIZED. Not decentralized in the western narrative sense but I'm the sense that China is structured into sections and the government can pretty much make temporary fiscal shift between those various sections, that's how they approached the poverty elevation. Sections which are successful are then used to support those that are not and it's the same with their fiscal policies. 
Then again people have been jizzing to the fall of China for decades"
"I think you need to factor in the comming food crisis this winter, plus the fraud that the Chinese banks perpetrated by fooling people into putting their money in investments thinking they were savings accounts."
"""China's economy is not going to collapse.""  

It' already collapsed in the sense that the growth trend, as previously experienced, is gone.  

From two years of 1000 year floods to COVID19 to today's heat wave China's growth is under water, something not seen in almost a full generation.

The bigger question is this: how will that affect the free world?  How far down the crapper will the real estate-banking crisis pull the world?

Finally, will Xi Jinping get re-elected?

China chaos, is real.

They ARE the second biggest economy in the world, or was.  The dream ride for China is over as corruption, debt, and over speculation all pile up on China's ""freeway"".  

Many wonder if Xi Jinping is trying to ""close"" China as Mao did.

1.4 billion people will always have an ""economy"" per se, that is a fact.  Yet, it's going to look much different."
Will the stimulus by the Chinese government to prevent a recession/depression be affordable given that their debt levels are already so high?
"Agree. A Japan style scenario is the most likely scenario. However some factors point in the direction that it will be worse than the Japanese experience. The population is aging more rapidly, economic freedoms are more limited and they have not achieved high income status like Japan has. Also we are not in an era of ever expanding globalization like in the 80s and 90s. So I think it will be worse. Who are they gonna export to if American and European companies bring back production to their home shores?"
"Certainly those videos, especially the headlines, are so sensationalized to the extent that they undermined their own credibility. But they all highlighted the ongoing saga of bursting the real estate bubble in China of the last few decades. Yes, a Japanese style of multi decade stagnation is definitely the most likely scenario going forward as the CCP will not allow any adjustment to the property market and banking industry. So, all the surplus properties at inflated prices and the associated bad debts would be a heavy burden to the society, plus a major drag to the local government finances. There is another aspect of of the Chinese economy highlighted by these sensationalized videos which is the private economy in China receding rapidly, and the state is actively taking over the market as the primary player in many sectors of the economy. So, those videos are wrong and correct simultaneously. No, the general economy won't collapse. Yes, the private economy is disappearing drastically."
Thank god someone called out those bs clickbaiters.
"If Red China didn't collapse under Mao, then it ain't collapsing now"
"Hahaha, ""hitting double 6s is unlikely....hitting double double 4s double 5s is more likely..."""
"For the last 2+ decades western media have been saying China's economy is collapsing, yet China continues to rise rapidly lol. Gordon Chang wrote a book in 2001 ""The coming collapse of China"" ü§£. I'm sick of western propaganda."
"As a Chinese living in China, I hardly agree with the idea that the economy will collapse in coming days, but I still doubt about some points of your idea. So-called 'stable' is simply for policital purpose rather than economic reason."
Isn't it more comparable to Japan bubble in the 80s?
It's just colonial angst and cope. There's a huge appetite for this anti-China videos because it helps people distract themselves from reality
USA never collapsed
"Good points, but let's not forget corporate bond martket's debt bubble. Many corps have gone past the due to pay off their bonds."
"You are right, IFFFFFFF, 30% of the debt in the country isn't bad, which it probably is.  The problem for you and the alarmists is that no one really knows anything.  Forecasting China is always impossible."
I knew we weren‚Äôt that lucky üòÇ F üá®üá≥ i hope Xi invades taiwan so we can begin to level mainland cities
"The Chinese government wont collapse but the entire way the government makes money is under threat. How do provinces in china make money? Through property sales, which are now down 70%."
You left out one big issue: Taiwan
"This account makes a lot of sense, good video!"
Finally a non-clickbaity and actually nuanced video
Spot on!
Serpentza and laowhy86 will came after you as an CCP propagandist
well anyone with brain will never believe those clickbait video
I wonder how many of these comments are bots? üòÇ
China will kill and destroy anyone to keep it's government rolling. It looks like the China people love the boot
To add to that Russian Ruble has been the strongest performing currency in 2022. That's capital control in action.
"Of course, l not only agree with this but have actually called out of them namely Zeihan."
"The Japan-like scenario is already enough troubling, considering that China is far from being a developed country."
Thank you so much for countering the doomsbait. I've been getting so many of those and they all seem to share the same sensationalist perspective.
Thank you for your excellent explanation.
Bots and sellouts
"China is going to have a hard time keeping their deal with the people of ensuring prosperity as the growth slows. People will have more filial confucian responsibilities mandated to them since old people have no state provided safety net. One child generation will find it hard to support 2 parents. Unemployment will also massively increase China's internal security costs, which is okay cuz confucian bureaucracy was built for maintaining internal security, but it'll have a hard time balancing internal and ever rising external security concerns. China will have to amend it's economic system and property relations, as economic inequalities brew social disharmony. An UBI scheme and massive automation with common factor ownership might work."
"let us say this in this way...psychologically speaking many (westerners) need ""China collapse"" to make themselves feel better. the same people will regard themselves higher than others unnecessarily solely for the purpose to make themselves feel better to avoid their own problems... the rest is just an excuse... you can find infinite amount of those.."
My observation from a similar 'scenario' exercise that fivethirtyeight did for what the Trump presidency would look like - trying to think holistically actually got in the way of accurate prediction. It was more helpful to think in terms of individual policy areas and personality traits. Perhaps the same is true here too.
"I definitely agree that the China Alarmist Bubble needs to be deflated. A short-term collapse is extremely unlikely. 

However, I think that you're underselling the likelihood of medium-term catastrophic instability. This could arise in several of different ways the next 2-3 years, due to difficulty in meeting unexpected challenges which may present themselves. The possibility of secondary sanctions due to the China's support of Russia during the Ukraine war, an even-more-severe drought than what is currently occurring, massive floods brought on by shifting weather patterns and increased speed of momentary rainfall, a major flare-up of COVID and a very aggressive responding lockdown response, all of these are significant possibilities over the next several years. Any of the above could have compounding knock-on effects on China's robustness as a society and as an economic force.

And then, looking down to the latter half of the 2020s, the demographic transition starts to look not so much similar in severity to Japan in the 1990s, but will be in fact truly unprecedented in scope. The rate of shift in the dependency ratio will be far, far more aggressive and fast-paced than what Japan faced during its demographic transition. Again, I'm not trying to argue for a high likelihood of an outright collapse. What I'm trying to get at is that long-term conditions substantially worse than what is being described as ""stagnation"" are highly plausible scenarios.

This is not even getting into the small-but-existent possibility of a major war in either the South China Sea or with Taiwan, which are black swan events which should always be kept in the back on one's mind when analyzing geopolitical matters in the East Asia region."
"Happy for that, it is very important for the balance of power to have strong China. I lived there and I loved it, hope to return asap."
I was thinking of this as just like the Japanese asset bubble of the 1990s ever since this evergrande crisis began rather than this doomsday prediction thanks for further supporting my perspective üòá
thanks for covering this level-headedly. i was sick of the sensationalist videos.
"Sounds like a red herring. What the critics of China really say ‚Äì not this out-of-the-blue comparison-with-US-1929 stuff ‚Äì is that the Chinese bank system is built up like a pyramid scheme. I think this channel is as unreliable, perhaps more unreliable than many of the channels it criticises."
"Of course no country will collapse ,  there is a common sense missing , they will adjust and back to the game , I am sick of the clickbaits !!!"
Good analysis
Thank you. I don't understand economics but I've listened to the YT China detractors. I was always skeptical so it was informative to hear why they are wrong.
"China‚Äôs path to ‚Äúsilent depression‚Äù or balance sheet recessions like Japan is on event horizon. Low credit growth caused by collateral shortage and downsizing of assets in the books. Look at USDJPY, the pace of JPY devaluation is abnormal. Japanese FSI are the intermediary for USD supply for China. Government fiscal investments has been yielding zero productivity for past 10 years. Just like Japan, I think China‚Äôs growth story is ended for foreseeable future, unless there is paradigm shift in their central planners."
Thanks!
"Japan got away with two decades of economic stagnation because their security was guaranteed by the US. China, on the other hand, will not survive this long under a stagnating economy since their government's promise to their people was that the CCP will wield unrestricted political power as long as they provided economic benefits. If they fail to deliver then its game over for the regime and that's why a collapse is the result."
"It‚Äôs hilarious to watch the reasons that China is collapsing/will collapse in the comments here because the vast majority of the reasons actually apply to Western economies. 

By their logic, Western economies should also be collapsing but of course they will never say THAT. 

So transparent and pathetic are these Sinophobes."
I want China to collapse.
"Russia's currency is not stabilized. its being artificially controlled.  you are making comparisons between the Chinese and U.S. economies but they dont seem to be heavily comparable. Visiual politic has a video called three myths of the chinese economy.  China has 1.4 billion people and 60% of population is poor. thats pretty high for one of the ""most developed"" countries in the world. im not educated enough to know if the economy is actually on the brink but basic information shows that china isnt the economic power many perceive it to be."
"I love you. Thank you for cutting through the bs and giving a realistic, non emotion based look at this situation"
"China's problem is demographic and won't happen in the span of days, it'll happen in he span of decades."
"You can't say ""well the government will fix it"" when the bad debt floating around is far in excess of anything the government can afford. The only way for them to do it is printing so much money that it would cause hyperinflation. A country forcibly spending it's way out of trouble makes things worse and not better."
I kinda want it to collapse.  Does that make it any more true?
"In all likelihood, while the Chinese economy is probably going down, barring unforeseeable events accelerating the timetable the timeframe would be measured in years, not weeks or months."
"I believe the stagnation process has started, and it is a shame because if the government wasn't causing so much uncertainty I think China actually has a lot of room to grow. If this is the start of a great stagnation, the standard of living in China is much lower than when the stagnation started in Japan. I just moved back to the USA from China, I paid almost $1000 a month for an 80 square meter apartment.  In the same building service workers sleep 8 people to a room with four sets of bunk beds. It is a shame the property system has made minimalist living mandatory, it is really bad for the country's domestic consumption."

"""China's economy will collapse in 5 years.""
~""Expert"" 10 years ago~"
No audio ?
Exactly they are to Smart
"There is no chance of China collapsing unless the Chinese people rise against the CPP, but there is no way for that to happen when the government controls everything they do, and even if they would manage to start something with the ridiculous amount of surveillance they are under the amount of people who would be killed doing that cannot even be estimated as the CPP wouldn't give two shits about murdering all dissidents or innocent civilians to maintain control."
"Economic collapse, virus crisis and Climate Crisis are taking their toll.
Infrastructure spending should focus on the Climate Crisis and invest more in wind and solar energy and environmental protection.
That will help the economy and reduce fossil fuels which need to be imported and are adding fuel to the climate fire."
"China's economy is in slow decline. The virus lock downs will speed it up.
Lower GDP, higher unemployment, property developer bankruptcies, small and medium businesses going broke, local governments running out of cash, local banks running out of cash and individual personal despair of the population will lead to lower consumer spending.
This will end up impacting the world economy and the US.  China will try to spend its way out of its decline with government stimulus and that will reduce prices of goods produced in China and shipped around the world. Inflation will decline. China is the worlds second largest economy. A slow down in China will slow demand for energy.  Steel production has declined and companies are going bankrupt because of the property developers stopped projects all over the country. The property developers collapse will ripple thru out the economy. Lock downs will make it worse. Individuals, corporations, bond holders and investors are leaving China. The ruffled feathers about Taiwan are meant to stir up people and have them rally around the CPP and China. They need to distract people from all the economic problems in China."
"There is no economic activity when the city is locked down.
Many small and medium businesses will go broke and employees will have no income.
Freedom of movement and freedom of speech are under appreciated until they are taken away."
"China is not going to collapse... it's already collapsed. 
When they say  5% GDP growth  that's a political number - NOT an actual number.  It's well below 1%.
I live in Shenzhen, which is basically one of the biggest economic hubs in China, and i can tell you this  it's not good. It's not quite dystopian, but a few years ago when people meet at a coffee shop or at dinner parties and chat about things they would talk about  ""how to make money"" and ""what is the best kind of investment for making good profit?"".   Now, the talk is:  ""how do i save more money,  and spend less?"". 
Walking past shops, shopping centers and such places all i see are more and more vacant shop spaces.  many of these shop spaces have been vacant for nearly 2 years.  Money is tight, the economy and the economic outlook is grim, everyone knows it, everyone feels it.  Most people are not even thinking about starting new businesses.  Then you have one entire generation who want's to  ""just let it rot"". They have zero ambitions, they don't know what they want to do,  most just want to live off the money their parents made.  They're not interested in having children. 
Will china collapse into dystopia?  Probably not,  will it become marginalized because other countries have sourced their electronics production elsewhere,  ..most likely.
I do a lot of product development /design,  most of the tech business that Americans were doing in Shenzhen moved back State Side to  Denver Colorado. More or less by  2018  most engineering projects here dried up or ended.  Not sure what to say but now the technology exists to  inkjet print entire PCBs along with all the passive components that go on them.  If someone has access to a  DoD (Drop on Demand) inkjet printer  - the individual transistors can be inkjet printed as well.   The tech is very new, software is not mature yet, but  give it 2-3 years  and china might be making some of these machines (though i doubt it because they have to be incredibly precise and high quality)  but electronics manufacturing is not going to be what they're doing.   In effect,  they've become marginalized.
As for the rest of their economy,  the world blames them for covid,  the majority of the world does not favor a  ""cheap made in china"" brand as they did before 2019.   Whether or not china made covid or not it doesn't matter. Many people believe they did and now they pretty much hate china.  The ""made in china""  brand has been burned to the ground.  This is another thing that has damaged their economy.
Will china collapse?  No.  Will it continue to deflate before it's  ""just one of those asian countries that used to make stuff for us""... probably."
"10:10 Be honest, how many times did you have to roll those dices until you hit double six?"
I think most of this sensationalism comes in 2 parts... 1) the perceive need to sensationalize for clicks and 2) the continuous campaign to demonize China will have people quick to call for china's collapse...
"Just in regards to ""trade surplus"" : China is actually STILL heavily dependent on other countries for coal and food. It's not food independent or energy independent, so its huge industrial sector, if corporations have too many issues with the huge swathe of human rights issues (+ literal g*n**ide,) or there are energy issues, and/or governmental interference, then the production CAN (or will need to) move over to other countries quite quickly. 
Not to mention that the UN and other international communities should and NEED to remove the ""developing country"" label that's currently applied to China (its official stance is that they've beat poverty, they're building rocket/spacefaring tech and have nukes which they have used for threats towards peaceful countries.) one of the major reasons why China is being used is not just the populace (quantity + intelligence) but rather the price of sending stuff out of country as well. Not to mention that they're literally threatening and even attacking other countries ships/planes (dropped ""chaff with small bits of aluminum"" which can easily ignite into Canadian recon plane's engines, or ""buzzing"" peaceful recon aircraft constantly, or the harassing and even attacking of ships) in international space.. Or the ""stealth fishing"" they do in other country's waters with no permission at a gigantic scale (theft).

The international community has been closing their eyes to literal g*n**ide for so long, with all the other coordinated actions that are lead by the Chinese government, together with all the pollution, etc - the denouncing and embargos/sanctions (+ removal of the ""developing nation"" status) should be considered with bi-partisan support."
You rock :)
"The Chinese economy has been a Ponzi scheme from the beginning with CCP officials and their friends raking in money while the state subsidized exports.  Trump's tariffs were the first crack in the facade, and their self induced pandemic split it wide open.  The actual GDP of China ranks lower than some African countries.  Just like your flashy neighbor with the big house, 2 cars  etc. all purchased with credit cards, and who's actual net worth is less than the homeless guy living under a freeway."
"It is most likely the beginning of the end of the CCP. The USSR was stagnating since the end the 60's, and it took 30 years for it to collapse. The same will most likely happen in China. After the short recession you mentioned, factories from foreign companies will start to close down and be moved either to India/Vietnam (cheap labour), back to the US/west (in a democratic country) or in eastern-Europe (best of both worlds). People forget the engine of the Chinese economy is fully depended on foreign companies while that was never the case of the US. And if China is stagnating they are unable to grow their domestic industry, especially if the west bullies China with tariffs and invest heavily in Indian companies. The demographic crisis (or more like collapse, compared to Europe/Japan, the again crisis in China is 10 times as bad) will ensure no growth in China for years to come. 

I don't think it will be a big explosive collapse, but it will be a recision paired with stagnation for +30 years. After a cold war of 30 years I think both Russia and China will collapse (Russia maybe earlier since the people there live more free)."
China is still on target to overtake US in GDP in 2030.
"Good article however ten people can‚Äôt be wrong against one like you
The Chinese economy is solely based on the outsourcing of foreign multi national corporations (mainly American) to China
This trend is now being reversed
Globalization is an environmental crime and only serves the shareholders
Companies which outsource to China need to be boycotted
In addition China debt traps entire nations China forces technology transfers from foreign companies China puts muslims in concentration camps and China oppresses its nice productive Chinese citizens
A country in which its citizens are oppressed will never flourish long term"
"The possibility holds more merit than one might think, considering the...  rumor?(many prominent political experts appear to claim this) is Xi was not even aware of the aftereffects on the chinese economy caused by their ban on australian coal, which caused massive blackouts, until after several months. Supposedly due to Xi:s neo-Maoist tract, which causes people to be too afraid to tell Xi whenever there are major problems, a shoot the messenger type situation. Even then, in all likelihood the worst possible outcome is that china seriously suffers for a month or two until someone bites the bullet and tells Xi about it, and they start to try to fix the problem via extreme government intervention."
Now not saying it will buuuut it would be funny it they did the opposite of what you‚Äôre saying.
You forget one factor in your analysis and that is the fact that the communist party basically is the monopolist of the entire economy. I share your opinion about the fact that China's prices wont drop that much (eventhough foreclosure business of there is booming at the moment) because the Chinese party can simply say the prices arent any lower. I do think that it will be harder for China to get credit from foreign markets... Because they do fck over foreign investors often...
There is no such thing as an expert economist.
Thank you for this. YouTube is full of this fearmongering garbage.
"Printing your own money has never halted an economic crisis, only created a worse one.
So dude, I admire your spirit, but THAT'S NOT MONETARY INDEPENDENCE. 
Let's try this: halt US trade with CCP, and let's just see how ""independent"" they really are..."
"You say all banks are owned by the government but that is not really what‚Äôs important Chinese citizens have billions of dollars that are used by these banks for those loans, how are they going to pay this back as well as the mortgage loans that will now be under water.  Chinese citizens don‚Äôt trust the government so this will get ugly"
"Unlike japan's political system, China's government is not more loyal to the United States than its people. So the cpc will not implement plaza accords like self flagellation. However the flipside is that it means Washington is more likely to initiate a military conflict with Beijing. It always seemed like the western arming of uyghur terrorists was the most likely vector but  China successfully rebuffed radicalisation which led to the afghani pullout. This collapse will always confuse me. I guess Taiwan is the new vector but we'll see. Hopefully Americans will collapse themselves further into a multipolar world where other systems will be allowed to develop."
You said I think so at least one of you're two points is your speculation which honestly it isn't different from what other YouTube channels say.
"have been telling the talking heads on you tube, China will not collapse, its to big to fail.it has plenty of money. These you tubers are using this as pure click bait."
"I don't pay attention to many channels on economics, this is one of the few."
"I think the demographic and de-globalization pressures China will be facing in the coming years will lead China to a slow growth Japan style stagnation. This is the best outcome because the loss of productive workers between the ages of 22 - 52 there will not be enough to remain the manufacturing powerhouse it was during the 1990s to 2015. It‚Äôs already lost being the cheapest place to manufacture in the world and with more countries not choosing China the decline will continue. Just my opinion though, anything is possible."
"i dont think i agree....how likely is it that millions in china will starve next year? there is a drought over there thats the biggest  they've had in recorded history, same as there is in many countries at the moment....while the fate of there economy may be uncertain, without water there is no industry, there is no agriculture, there is no power (well maybe solar/wind) the ccp are not gods, its looking to me that there is going to be a massive calorie shortfall on mainland china and there there will not be anywhere with a surplus that can export it to them. unless there is a miracle something very terrible is going to happen over there and it will not be a slow decline. hopefully i'm wrong."
I believe it'll slow down for chinese standards but not even flirt with recession or stagnate. Specially if they ease or erase the zero covid policy to spur internal market to pick up again.
Collapse of China will be painful to the world economy growth
"You fail to mention the great demographic collapse. Already the fasting aging society of the world, no 30-something yo to have children due to the one child policy and they are overcounting their population probably by 100 million people.
China will never recover to pre pandemic levels"
"But‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶the Great Cathie Wood says China is about to collapse! She‚Äôs been so wrong for so long that she‚Äôs due to be right this time!

Seriously though, last week I watched one of the collapse videos shown in this video and thought it made sense, then looked at their other videos and saw Cathie Wood featured as an expert and was like‚Ä¶nope. This person shouldn‚Äôt be trusted. 

Btw, I did a search to make sure I was spelling her name right and saw a video from three weeks ago of her warning that we‚Äôd all be ‚Äúterrified‚Äù a week ago. That same channel has a video today warning that it‚Äôll happen by the end of this month. I definitely think she‚Äôs paying people to make videos promoting her."
"Creo que falta mucho an√°lisis sociol√≥gico y geopol√≠tico.

"So the ""solution,"" is just to refinance the banks, which somehow won't merely end up reinflating the bubble? Get real."
"So, Ray Dalio's Chinese investment does not cloud his judgement and you did not even touch on the people not paying back their mortgages. People know more about china and you merely gloss over.

"China is going to be global economic hegemon, then things will get interesting.

"The ""bank runs"" are apparently caused by some rando regional/village banks, established by some certain ""well-connected"" personnel of ""Cyprus national"", using impossibly high interest rate (stock-market-return-rate) to attract people to put their life savings in those ""saving accounts"", heavily promoted by some multi-level marketing-esque drive, and the said ""saving services"" is in fact some investment product, as most savers don't have too much access to the larger banks and are of lower literacy level, especially in legalese.

And through some shell companies siphoning and accounting black magic, most of the money went to somewhere else to cover some money gap in some local financing vehicles and the respective investment.

The entire thing is of course an absolute shitshow."
Dude I don't think consumer confidence is going to return to the real estate market there. People will stop buying (investment) real estate which is the main engine for the economy aswell as for municipal revenue. Sure they can print money but confidence is broken. Same as '08 in my opinion. I think you are wrong. These authoritarian regimes and top to bottom policies  work very well until they completely cease to work as is the case with USSR. Time will tell who's right
I completely agree with the author of this video. Chinese system is so different from the West. China does not have the rule of law.
Now that YOU say ‚Äúit‚Äôs unlikely‚Äù the world can rest easy now.
"Agree, clickbait sensationalism is just that.
Also: the problem is that stability and capital controls depend on POLITICAL continuity. And stagnation would void the contract between the chinese population and their political caste."

"Very nice to hear another view!  Refreshing. Still hope the CCP falls (gracefully), but I wouldn't put money on it."
"I agree about the basic narrative, the doom videos are exagerating the problem, however, you did not adress the fact that all the local governments rely on selling land to build property to fund the local government, and they are running out of land to sell, resulting in ""collapse"" of the local governments finances. There is also the fact that China is dependant on exports since the internal market is much smaller compared to the US, and the global economy is going into recession resulting in difficulty by China to export themselves out of this problem. China has also gotten a bad reputation the last 10 years and more and more countries in the west, where most exports go, is starting to buy things from other countries instead of China, due to aggressive diplomats, and general aggression in the South China sea. Or am I wrong?"
People are overlooking real data that cannot just be casually faked by government like 2.5 freaking trillion dollars/year in exports. Real Estate collapse cannot destroy that just like the 2008 crisis didn't wiped out Big Tech.
"Fun fact, the countdown days on the thumbnails most commonly point to a certain date of 10th September, which coincidentally is the Mid-Autumn festival."

*People assume that chinese people adore the government they really aren‚Äôt that happy because the government have control over the people if a you was a dictator would do exactly the same thing no free traveling no free speech no question about the government not thing, deleted these comments you don‚Äôt like is facts and truth my boi, truth does hurt doesn‚Äôt it.*

*Fourthly red flag.*

If something doesn‚Äôt goes what China excepted they blame others and they never admitting  themself never I have heard that Chinese government have failed the people never think they would, China are buying leaders around Africa and forced these citizen rather you like it or not to China for work to them, you do not have right if authorities government selling their citizen to another country.*

*The five red flag.*

*Russia & China are destroying America itself every election they trying to divide the American üá∫üá∏ people there is an old Japanese üáØüáµ  word saying { If a country are divide soon they would United but if a country is United much longer they would be separated } so people would seek leader and have different ideologies and that is what China really hopes for.*"
"Don't agree. First China is not like Russia. Russia has lots of natural products to export, China has to import everything then convert these imports into products to export. China has nothing, no energy, no food, no water, etc etc etc.With deglobalization it will even be difficult for China to import oil from the Gulf, 5000 miles away. Companies are leaving China and causing huge unemployment, the young people of China are giving up on having a successful life, because it is too difficult to succeed. Hopefully everything is in place for the evil CCP to collapse."
China haters have been saying this since year 2000.
CHINA WILL COLLAPES IN 60 MINS
Lmao you‚Äôve been seeing those videos as well yh. So stupid.
You are nonsense China economy will continue collapsing. But this will be good for the people of China because only CCP will be the one to collapse.
"You haven't mentioned another key difference, which is control of information in China. So, bank run is a lot less likely, because there are plenty of people who will believe in the news (everywhere in China), telling them that all the banks are OK. So, yup, zero chance that China will collapse. But more likely like you said, stagnant growth like Japan for a prolonged period of time due to demography and property bubble continues to drag down the economy for a prolonged period of time..."
"You left out the internal growth China used to get where they are now. The buildings, cities, highways to grow have to slowed as they shore up other sectors. They have to rob peter to pay paul. They are trying to spur their economy while devaluing their currency. It is not the internal goods that is going to hurt. It is the external goods."
"the best analysis  of china problems , except that it is possible they still have growth despite ageing population
if they succeed with IA and robots !"
"Over the next six months, China will devalue its currency by 40% to make their workforce irresistible to foreign investors (again) and reverse the capital drain. Global inflation will moderate and Chinese job growth will surge. Western countries will struggle with high unemployment in manufacturing sector. Just a guess though."
"Your reaction perfectly mirrors that of serpentza, who understands China extremely well:
https://youtu.be/Caay18H9QvY"
You buy dollars or euro or maybe pounds
"LOL ! China is BEING COLLAPSE. Useless eaters of Yuval Hariri. Walked into a TRAP of the WEF - it was NEVER meant to succedd but to rape the people of their sweat and labor thur greed and follishness and now with Darpa's AI that can feast on Human Coprses as Bio-Fuel it's Chinese take-out time !!!!!! Moo Goo Gai Pan anyone. There is no longer a need for the useless carp China pollutes this world with and the bad taste, greed, crass coveteousness - everything China touches is made CHEAP....anyways for a sheeplike people that can't stand up for themselves or look after themselves, scared, afraid, addicted to the technohellverse, infantile and stunted, showing NO REMORSE for your crimes, your plagues....your VICTIMS cry out for JUSTICE !!! Buh-Bye Chyna - you won't be missed."
"CCP leaders are definitely not idiots and they have for sure learned from economic crises history.
However they at least one weak point - the party's ideology. They are very unlikely to make a decision or action if it contradicts the general party line or cause a potential treat for the CCP power, even if the decision is beneficial for population or economy. I think Zero-covid policy and with its crazy lockdowns and aggressive pushes against IT giants are good examples of such decisions.
And it may be the case for this Chinese economic crisis as well. For example, they may decide to keep the social stability no matter the cost, or continue to widely shut down entire regions for months because of Covid."
"I agree with the points that are brought up, but one of the major things I find missing from the video is discussion on how local governments were funded by land sales to these companies.   Im not well versed in how China sets up its administration, but it's my understanding that the central government basically gives broad orders, and its up to the local government to figure out how they want to execute those orders.  I remember reading how border towns in China have been basically under strict lock down for much of the pandemic, but they given very little support when they asked for it from the higher ups in the political food chain.  With these land sales drying up, will that affect how the government can intervene or is this just implied in the conclusion about the stagnation/decline prediction?"
Not china
"Air they create
The gringos have money that many countries use as investment"
"Put this on your phone app. If China's economy doesn't collapse, then the CCP will collapse."
I'm just gonna wait 25-27 days and see who was right
"I""m a PHD in Economics also. I don't even bother to watch these videos. They are clickbait."
Thank you for this video
"If you dont buy 
They will go back as before"
Real content here.... those popular channels are just click bait.
Because they  gave it to them
"It won't collapse in the same manner as in the US, but I am of the opinion that China will collapse.   CCP is good at presenting.  
The only way China can save itself is to recover the stolen money from corrupt CCP officials and higher-up of large corporations.   I highly doubt it happens."
Your probability example at the end is implying the reverse of your intention. The probability to get a double 6 is the same as a double 3...
"I don't take this collapse talk seriously, but the political situation over there is odd. I suppose it is a matter of personal preference for authoritarianism if you think the big centralizing moves from the current regime are stabilizing or destabilizing. The current centralization of authority, and moves to make the current leader permanent, are more along the Russian model than the model China used for its growth in the previous regime."
"This is the same reasoning and outcome that I have come to. Personally the largest variable I see, is whether the Chinese government will be forced to be become more democratic due to this crisis. The reason being that with the population shift going on, combined with a smaller monetary compensation to the lower and middle class. These groups will look for other forms of compensation for ""being ruled"", so far it his been done by increased wealth, but this will be less likely in the future.
So, we might see an increased focus on unionization and worker rights, combined with other human rights demands like democratic reforms.
Unless, what we will see if a more suppressed population. Looking at Hong Kong, this might seem like the more likely scenario but imo. there is a huge difference between locking down and controlling a fairly small urban area like Hong Kong and doing the same with major parts of China as a whole.

Great vid"
tis unfortunate
I kind of agree with you. It makes me question the reliablity of those youtubers
"As someone living here , having a Chinese wife that works for the local Government this is my observation. Real estate in most tier 1/2 cities has been in a bubble waiting to pop and has came down a little this year. This would go hand in hand with CCP's rhetoric of housing should be for living and not speculation and hopefully they will introduce the new property tax in trail mode in certain provinces to bring it down a little more. But in saying that for my city when ever I go past any construction sites they are all full steam ahead and there are literally  hundreds of them.
Bank runs as far as I know were mainly in the Henan province due to the Rural bank saga ( bank was allegedly  infiltrated by organized crime ) assets frozen as a audit and investigation happen, as it is not a State own bank the peoples money was not insured , complicated and will take too long to explain.

Mortgage dispute is mainly for some low tier cities , with some issues in some larger cities, mainly due to covid supply issues as well as some smaller developers maybe over leveraged .The  central Gov has asked some banks to give a 6 month grace period on payments  to those worst effected  as well as injecting cash to get the projects on track ( this effects maybe 1% of all mortgages in China )

Most cities have not suffered too many major covid lock downs since 2020, only notable  exceptions are Shanghai early this year and some parts of Beijing  the worst effected with a few sporadic cases here and there( Fuzhou where I live no lock down since June 30 2020 )

Due to China's 24/7 online shopping  for anything and everything with an excellent delivery/postal service  the effects of lock downs could be some what offset , I know this personally as my wife gets something delivered daily ü•¥ .  Grocery / food shopping is commonly  done via apps and home delivered ( I seldom go to the supermarket )
My wife is Finance manager for the transport sector and she said most projects for our area are running on time ( roads , bridges ect )

Food cost have not really change too much and the stock market seems ok ( well my investments anyway are all well up , but maybe I am just good at it üòÑ)
As I live directly across from Taiwan 160 km to be precise the mood of the people is normal and there is nothing abnormal to prior the cross straight tensions ,if anything it seems quieter than before the Pelosi visit as for a while there it would be common to hear jets once or twice a week )
Anyway not saying there aren't any issues just speaking from my own personal experience, but I am far from being an economic expert !
One other notable thing is  we haven't had Typhoons yet , which is uncommon  and it has been stinking hot .
Ok take care ."
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt trust a real estate agent YouTuber to tell you about economics.
"When all governments basically make up their GDP data, how reliable is any of this analysis for an opaque economy like China?  Even with all the shutdowns, can we trust their production numbers?"
"Most of those economic channel is run by west and i don't trust west üòÇüòÇ and it's funny how most of these youtubers are white , is this a coincident or they can't see other non white countries growing in power?üòÇ"
"I agree with the analysis. However, China has one positive attribute. It is willing to learn. It cannot finance it's global ambitions with a dead capital market. Hence, I think it will allow great entrepreneurs to become rich"
"Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering though- could the social contract that China offered with economic growth being traded for economic freedoms being not acceptable to its population- compared to a democracy that could accept both? 

Ie if the common people lost trust in banks, property, investing, financial stability and all the benefits of a growing economy- then why trust the government? Why trust a government overseeing a stagnating economy when you don‚Äôt have a political voice? 

Could this in turn make it more frail than Japan, South Korea & Taiwan who have shrinking economies alongside democracies?

I agree that all these titles are click bait, but if you look at what Peter Zeihan is saying, I‚Äôm inclined to believe that a potential collapse scenario is possible- and likely to occur within a decade as it‚Äôs becomes an uncompetitive economy that fails to go up the chain of value added goods alongside a demographic crisis. And thus a collapse scenario is one that cannot be predicted ( unlike these YouTube guys)- and will occur suddenly, but no one knows how.  

It‚Äôs record export surplus is also not sustainable with a failure for a good domestically produced vaccine- and thus endless zero covid, a population that has already peaked a decade ago according to leaked documents, and an uncompetitive economy that has a shrinking workforce but a terrible education system, and is still a poor country overall compared to its eastern neighbors."
"I would think that the recession in China is gonna be a quick one. I believe that they are now shifting the investing yens of the people from property to the stock market. A flow of capital to entrepreneurs and listed corporations is gonna boost the productivity as capital can be raised more easily. Furthermore, I don't think the super innovative big tech (e.g. Tencent) is going anywhere, they are going to thrive in the future as well, as long as they play fair."
"Thanks for the update!  Now I know I can order an inexpensive, high-quality Telecaster copy from China."
"""Collapse"" it's a big word, and people love to use big words without thinking. China walking toward an economic disaster, a lot of countries went through economic disasters. And majority of these countries didn't experience in economic collapse."
"The only point of contention with the video is that I think rapid recovery is less likely than collapse due to other environmental and control driven crisis. But yes, I also predict China is going to go through a slow contraction to stagnation for a few years/decades.

Thing is, the CCP is notoriously stubborn with it's policies. Just look at how long the child policy stayed even after the problems it caused became obvious. The second problem is corruption but since it is seemingly being quashed, I'll take the wait and see approach."
"I think the next three quarters will tell us what the next three years of China‚Äôs economy will look like, while the next three years will tell us what the next decade will look like."
"Happy you think that way.. now go invest in the country, go buy some shares in some of the companies.ü§ó Don‚Äôt be a fake and invest your money"
"Those youtubers have no idea about China, they interpret reality by Western lense and just repeat "" trendy"" topic for vievew."
"It really is annoying to see the YouTube algo become an echo chamber.  Once Graham Stephan gets his hands on it, you know it‚Äôs at peak BS and everyone will copy his content."
Very objective and insightful
"I agree with the slow decline, but that decline may happen a little faster than many observers think. For example, it's possible that Chinese growth will surpass 5% in 2023 as a correction for the very dull 2022, but that may be the last time China sees 5+% growth."
I don't agree with one word you said .. Are you russian ?? That explains
"Great counterpoints. I think the most likely scenario is a Japan-esque slow decline as the aging population is going to erode China‚Äôs manufacturing prowess. Which by extension erode China‚Äôs currency independence. Thing will be able to be produced for cheaper in other parts of the world. China, specifically it‚Äôs belt and road initiatives, will become more of a consumer / service based economy, but if it cannot over take the US as the global reserve currency, its likely to remain a regional superpower rather than global. Chinas population is expected to fall to 0.8B by 2040. So the decline is relatively rapid. Couple that with the lessons learned over Covid and the on-shoring of key manufacturing products like semiconductors, we should see de-globalization of the global supply chain become more of a trend. I think this all ends in a bifurcated world, which is the best outcome for competition and resiliency (economies / supply chains)."
"you are right,actually,so many youtubers never know fundermental economics,they just meet anti-china needs,literally,china is huge,very rich at manufacture"
"your videos are simply amazing, keep it coming!"
Stagnation is the most likely scenario given what we know about population dynamics and their effects on an economy.
This situation reminds me the fear mongering about the end of the world in 99's lol
"Yeh, there's a tendency for the less sensational outcome to be the most likely, and we're not going to see an implosion. That being said, it looks like long term winds are not in China's favor, and the predicted outcome in this video seems to be most likely."
"I disagree that one child policy is bad because over population is even worse than aging population. Even today, China don't have enough job for its youth population because of the high education requirement to train them all. Not to mention, China don't have enough resource to sustain such a big population, especially with drought coming now. The solution are AI, automation and biotech research for anti aging, which China is investing trillions into now."
someone has watched serpentza and laowhy86!
USA would collapse before china
i wonder how much he got paid by China for this video
"China will collapse eventually. Could be tomorrow. Could be 100 years from now. Could be 1000 years from now. 

""The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."""
No you are wrong.  And you have been proven to be wrong throughout ALL OF YOUR VIDEOS.
There only one i trust when it comes to Macroeconomics on youtube is you.  Thanks for all your work.
Where does the flight of manufacturing come in?
"If Xi end tech crack down and Covid Zero, then economic growth is possible. Otherwise, China will be part of the global recession for the next few years."
isnt the chance of getting double 6 and double 5 the same? i get the point tho.
"Majorley missing the point and I would contend, as click baitey as the videos you cite. China's issues are many and crucially are in play at the same time, which IS the issue. Your focus on monetary independance (while accepted) is only one factor and I would have liked for you to delve more into the other 3 reasons that you literally spend 10 seconds on, as fellow contributory factors alongside the financials. I would also say that even if these factors are ""minor"" and CCP spends its way out of the housing collapse, bank investment problems and suddenly springs 4 children per family, money does not bring energy security which is China's bigger issue, and one missing from this video. I do Biz / import product from China by container and I can confirm Factories are shuttered due to no energy availability. Ports are closed due to covid lockdowns (3 seconds on that one?) so suddenly, China's World manufacturing status is in jeopardy as stock is not being made and not moving in a lot of cases. What was a rock solid supply chain mechanism is now flaky AF with transit times to UK now 8 weeks from 4 weeks pre covid. And don't get me started on the local Govt debt to the CCP and their management of Grain and other foodstuffs, including fuel / energy for the local populace, which again is being found out to be false levels due to years of corruption & selling, making sure CCP targets are hit for kickbacks with no checks on whether these target hits are genuine. Is the Grain there?? No, it is not, so they will have to buy from outside, further driving world prices and using up that crucial foreign reserve, because the USD $ is still world reserve right?? China's GDP numbers are untrustworthy and are there to flatter the party only. 

The whole set up is a house of enormous cards and they are starting to fall for very genuine reasons. Now, while it may not be complete collapse, it weill be a fall of a kind and it may fall into Nationalism which is even more dangerous a situation as the fundament issues will never be addressed and it will all be ""our"" fault. 

My tin foil hat thesis is that Xi is trying to break the CCP from the inside and all of this intentional. If not, then he has Stokholm syndrome, which is frightening...  

Your video is like teaching me to bowl and instructing me that I only need 1 finger to do so. Do better please."
Wouldn't bailing out the banks in China cause massive inflation?
"Yes! Thanks for this video!! I can‚Äôt see a collapse coming either, and I might even see the opposite! Housing crisis will be short like you said, though I believe the stimulus will be directly to citizens and not the housing industry itself. ‚ÄúGreening‚Äù China will keep them going for a while longer - they have to, as most of their population live in areas that could suffer deadly wet bulb temperatures. It‚Äôs already leading the world in solar/battery tech, and will benefit more if Europe follows (which they will, if America goes on one last oil hurrah with trump, but would also benefit if America also goes green). I believe they‚Äôve gone after the tech giants to avoid having the Google-Facebook-apple monopolies, citing more competition as an excuse but more to reduce political power, though both points are valid, as demonstrated in the US. As regards to lockdowns, they could soon be over if ever a cure/vaccine that they deem to be good enough becomes available, probably sooner rather than later. And despite predicted population declines, it‚Äôs still a domestic economy of 1.3billion people. So with a big [green] stimulus, a solid tech and manufacturing industry, plus exports, plus a massive domestic economy - you can see why I‚Äôm not even sure about stagnation, but can see some growth."
"Isnt it true that the ""three red lines"" have been largely ignored by banks?"
coolüòé
I love these youtube prophets xD sensation all over
"Real Estate is 30% of China's  GDP.  investors by the 100s of thousands are protesting the collapse by stopping their mortgage payments further collapsing the banking system.   it is worse than the 90s collapse of Japan's Real Estate and the 2008 Great Recession.  Also, local provincial governments budgets are also collapsing.  Why? Because their main revenue came from land developers like Evergrande the biggest Ponzi Scheme ever.  How are they going to recover those losses over the next few years?  The only other industry that can replace those year after year losses is the manufacturing sector.  Taxation.  How is that going to affect the industry as a whole in the next few years? That is still to be seen."
Most of the solutions being described would cause terrible inflation and/or massive damage to the country. For manufacturing a lot can be moved out and many companies are actively working on it. Total collapse maybe not but their move to super power seems highly unlikely at this point which I see as a good thing. I would hate to see to much suffering for the population but would prefer if their government didn‚Äôt became too powerful.
China is gonna disintegrate .. this pulls a lot of views .
"Sinophobic western media has been crying about China's impending collapse for three straight decades. Foreign Affairs literally recycles the same exact headline every 5 or 6 years, because it's SOOOO imminent. üôÑ This is capitalism is decay, desperate to paint a better system that actually helps people as some kind of folly, when, in reality, it is the west that is collapsing."
China is a dictatorship under Xi and he isn't getting accurate information. so it's not like a bunch of highly educated economist are making the best decision based on all the information. Xi has literally shot the messengers so often that he is living in a bubble. So assuming that China won't collapse is showing an extreme amount of faith in Xi and his understanding of economics. The real problem is that we know more about what's going on in China than the person running China. I'm sure Xi will dictate whatever he thinks is best and the politicians will enact them but that doesn't mean squat. Just look at zero covid Xi's personal idea that's done so well.
"These things are complex and it's hard to judge from a distance. From what I can judge, there is a lot of dissatisfaction within China. The government can manipulate the economy, but reduced growth and increased repression is likely only going to fuel dissatisfaction. In my perception that's the biggest risk for China, at some point it might explode."
I‚Äôm callin it. If China doesn‚Äôt accept capitalism in the vein of western europe üá™üá∫ they will collapse by 1970‚Äôs
"Omg a good economist channel, wtf.."
Nowadays any Western commentary on China/Russia is highly politicized and basically worthless.
"1930 = great depression
2008 = great recession
2022 = great stagflation (?)"
"The demographics issue is a serious problem in China for a number of reasons. First, it seems highly unlikely that China will be able to exponentially expand productivity per citizen in a way that makes up for the collapsing demographics. Second, immigrants aren't exactly risking their lives to immigrate to China, and with Western countries facing their own demographics issues, when the doors do open to immigrants China seems likely to lose that battle. Finally, the CCP is clearly an autocratic government and they are cracking down at exactly the wrong time. Covid lockdowns, tech suppression (read: kidnapping and bankrupting), saber rattling with Taiwan, oppression of Hong Kong. The CCP liked growth when it made them look good, but now Chinese citizens are getting too uppity and it's becoming a threat to the status quo. Autocratic governments can't let markets run free or they may lose influence. China doesn't make it out of the 2020's in it's current form. It may remain a single unified country, but Xi Jin Ping likely doesn't remain a unified person. A Japan style outcome is possible, but not under the current form of CCP."
THANK YOU <3 !!! You are making the world a more equal place by providing financial literacy for the people whoo need it the most. Also you are providing a much needed facts based media source in this increasingly polarising media environment!
"You talk about capital controls as if it is something good. Once a country places capital controls, people will need decades to trust that country again‚Ä¶"
So China is not stonks but not to the degree click baiters claim
A double four or a double 5 are as likely as a double 6 with dice
"10:20 Typical backgammon player ü§£
Odds of rolling 3x3 or 5x5 or 6x6 is equal, 2.8%

Your dice metaphor just confirmed you don't know what you're talking about
"So you say that China just needs to print more money, as much money as the banks, property developers and local governments need to solve its problems? With no consequences to inflation/money devaluation? And you kinda completly ignored other major problems China is facing right now, such as the democrafic crisis. I'm not in the club of those that think China will collapse in 20 days, but I'm also not in the club of those that kinda oversimplify and gaslight the real problems China haves..."
"Props for not bowing to the algorithm. Though, to be fair most people making the clickbait videos are probably in a tougher spot in terms of making a living off of YouTube. Incentives are a bitch."
"LOL I laughed so hard at your reaction Doctor.
It‚Äôs the best response an economists can show to all these wild predictions.
It‚Äôs weird like how many recessions the US had survived but for some reason people are convinced that China on the contrary will definitely collapse in a recession or a depression."
Great video. But I love the watch and the NATO strap.  Can we get a wristwatch check???
China won't collapse. The reason is the totalitarian regime they're running. If something happens they could simply wipe it off. The real problem they are facing is low birth of the population. But this is the same issue every nation has to deal with!
The China show just realised a video saying it will collapse in 3 days
"As long as China keep exporting stuff, it won't collapse."
I disagree. I think it will collapse because all empires collapse. I don't know when and I don't know why: but it will happen.
"My money would also be on the drawn out stagnation in the long run. My reasoning being that with the CCP now firmly installed once more as the single arbiter of power, there is simply no political incentive for the nation to move forward. It's demographic cliff and subsequent loss of productive power will make it a downward trend but it will be slow.
Thank you for another great video. I'm not sure it's important to this video, just wanted to add that from what I remember, the US policy of the day during the great depression was a somewhat curated dying of the banks with the administration practically deciding systemic relevance case by case. Different times when considering what a US government could do with its mandate back in the day."
"Thank you for this. I've viewed the underline to see what's going on in the Chinese economy. And while bad, it was never enough to collapse the second biggest economy in the world."
"Yeah, China is not collapsing but life there will be complete shit people will not have children and is going to go completely backward with war when it happens nad everything depending on how it goes, you know there is a world where it takes Taiwan with low cost and dominates the markest for years. I don't get one thing though why are people here so outspoken for China not collapsing XD? What you want to be a bitch slave to big yellow bear is that it some fetish thing?? But tbh the bigest reason why Chine won't collaps is that its people are so deaply indoctrinated that tey wont revolt no matter what probably this protest for paying mortgages is the furthest it will ever go, and its not like its there fault everything is so well controlled there you cant make an atempt."
"Things like these take on a life of their own, spreading among all those whose income depends on clicks.   China does have massive problems - the historical reluctance to go beyond her borders, demographics, incredible debt but the biggest may be the CCP and its insanity - aligning with Russia and fighting the West (it's largest trading partner by far), going after successful enterprises and entrepreneurs, acting as if it knew best when nobody believes it."
"Economically your video doesn't make sense, you're proposing that China's central bank can just print itself out of debt...  Never works..."
We can only dream that the ccp would collapse
Not so sure they learned their lesson from the US. They started the popping the bubble but decided to dial things back when they realized how dire things are. They are reducing interest rates as other countries are raising them. Personally I think the country will be in stasis till xi 3rd term at which point corrective measures and their consequences will be met out.
"A story that wasn‚Äôt reported in the West that recently came out is that China recently forgave 23 loans to 17 African countries. 

It‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt fit in the Western media‚Äôs narrative of China‚Äôs supposed ‚Äúdebt trap diplomacy‚Äù which is ironic given how the IMF and World Bank loans actually function (not to mention loans from private Western banks like Blackrock)"
"Harsh covid lockdowns?
I wish we had lockdowns in the US  lmaoo"
"Nonsense is correct, he did not apply the Global affects within China's econ."
China will collapse in 4 billion years when the sun swallows the earth from its expansion üò±üò±
"Yeah, I was skeptical as well when all the sensationalist youtube videos started popping up. Thanks for offering a more realistic scenario!"
"Important to point out that the ‚ÄúOne Child Policy‚Äù was not applied universally and that certain minority populations like the Uyghurs were exempt from such a policy. China is now trying to enact a 3rd child policy but the problem is that birth rates across the globe in middle and developed nations have declined. Japan never had a One Child Policy and it still has very low birth rates. Europe as well. 

It‚Äôs the price of becoming an affluent nation because affluent nations tend to have more educated women who enter the workforce rather than staying home as ‚Äúbreeders‚Äù and also these nations have greater access to birth control."
This is the biggest bubble but with more historical data to go off of China is trying to proactively fix it. So anywhere between the Great recession and getting off better than Japan is my range guess.
Fear mongers
"I think China is closer to Argentina than Japan. A economic system on paper that should be good but because the government is so corrupt it does not function as expected. You may what to look at how China handles its debt. It forced the local governments to take on large amounts of debt in December of last year. It also subsidies everything to stay competitive generating more debt. Yes they have strict control over their monetary system but it is being used to manipulated markets in a way the creates more bubbles (over financed). Their import/export heavy economy is dependent on the good will of the US, which they have been antagonizing. All together, that really is not good for their economy."
SUPER SUMMARY !
"They won't collapse in the next week. But, they import 80% of their energy, and they are last in line to get it. Much of the energy they are getting from Russia will go completely offline in the next few years cause they no longer have the expertise to keep it running. They import like 80% of their food. They culled much of their pig herd a few years ago, which is a huge source of food for them, they may have to do that again this or next year. On top of that, they are only an industrial powerhouse cause all the infrastructure that is already there, they are no longer the lowest cost producer of anything.  Lastly, even if there is no catastrophic event, their population halves in the next 30 years. 

Not likely they make it out of the decade without a collapse, they are 100% fucked by 2050."
‚ÄúThe Chinese economy is different than the US‚Äôs was in 2008 and 1929 therefore it will not collapse‚Äù what
"Can someone list all of the ‚ÄúChina will collapse‚Äù clips from this video? I want to make sure I‚Äôm unsubbed from all of them. 

Thanks in advance."
"To me it's just impossible to compare China with any other country. Since they have their unique combination of political structure and economic power. 

Also, and this is something you can't find in the west, is that China's censorship allow them to do things western countries cannot. In the most recent electric shortage, the government essentially cut off electricity  to the rural areas to save its urban population. And resulted in many older folks in villages and towns dying from the heat. That is perfectly reasonable from a ends justifies means perspective, but in any country with free media it would create a shitstorm. This type of thing happens all the time, where individuals are sacrificed over and over  ""for the greater Good"" with very little knowledge from the populous"
"Economic stagnation is absolutely the most likely scariest for China. If we look past the click-bait, most of these YouTubers are saying that this is the collapse of China‚Äôs record economic growth from the past few decades.
The hope is that economic stagnation will bring political upheaval."
"I think China will avoid Japanese stagnation through global investments like 1B1R. 

While it may have a demographic problem in 2040, China‚Äôs elderly of 2040 will likely be more economically productive than Japan‚Äôs elderly of 2000 due advances in technology that allows them to shoulder the load and the scale of China‚Äôs population over that of Japan‚Äôs in general. 

But even assuming these populations have the same characteristics, China‚Äôs investments via 1B1R are tapping into younger populations in the Global South for increased growth externally. The saying ‚ÄúAfrica is China‚Äôs China‚Äù could very well be the case. Japan never had that much international pull (possibly because the US didn‚Äôt want them to) and thus wasn‚Äôt able to pull out of its stagnation. 

Also, as mentioned in this video, China has achieved monetary independence which Japan wasn‚Äôt able to have in the 1990s and 2000s which gives it more financial optionality. 

China may eventually collapse but I‚Äôll likely be dead before that happens (and no, I don‚Äôt plan to collapse anytime soon)"
"Economist youtuber with no biases and try their best to deliver the truth, no way. Are you even real?"
"Every time I see a ""China Collapsing"" video its like that ""hey I've seen this one before"" scene in back to the future."
"Good to see another perspective.  My question is about the loans that China has to places Sri Lanka and Pakastan, those will have a big impact on China."
"Idk man those clickbait videos with cherrypick sources screaming ""CHINA NOW COLLAPSING"" seem totally legit, don't bring logic into my ""CHINUHBAD"" narrative"
"Imagining that the CCP plays by the same rules as any other society is a big mistake.  That's the same people of the great leap and the cultural revolution. There is no rule of law,  there are no individual rights,  there are no property rights.  CCP can just reset whatever mortgages it wants, confiscate whatever property or bank accounts, print whatever amount of money, tell people to suck it and shup up or die.  Even the concept of capital controls is a joke. You own no capital in China for it to be controlled. Just round up high networth people and confiscate. They are corrupt anyway.
So no,  China will only care if the rest of the world stops trading with it,  and that's only until they decouple and isolate on their own terms."
I saw like 3 videos claiming this and just waited for your video tbh
what is behind all these anti-china videos? what is the agenda? is it america/ned funding these?
i'm sorry but a japanese lost decades type of scenario is still a collapse in my opinion. it may not bring down the world with itself but will still cause a massive shift in the economy.
China is the next japan
"Sounds plausible. But even if they're getting most needed stimulus, I can see an scenario that the local governments in China would use corruptions trough their state owned banks, to laundry the stimulus checks out of the country. The owner of Geely (the Chinese automobile manufacture, whom owns the Volvo brand) did just like that, to fraud the Swedish government on companies taxes, by setting off shore companies to own the entire brand. The China's officials can do the same. That's why Xi was setting anti corruptions laws. But who watch the watchers?"
look i don't like china But when i saw like 5 videos per day saying that china will collapse i called usa propaganta that second.anyway good to see someone realy looking into this and explaining it clearly
RENCANA RUSIA AKHIR ZAMAN EKONOMI DUNIA ISLAM YANG KUASA TAPI KITA SALAH JALAN BANYAK BELA AMERICA SEKARANG INI CINA YANG KUASA EKONOMI DUNIAüòé
"Oh hell yes finally, a level-headed analysis. I tried watching just one of those click-baity contents, had quite the facial gymnastics in response to the sensationalism, and wished you would cover the topic. Such a nice surprise to see a notification of this video. Thank you very much!"
"A political collapse is more likely than an economic collapse. If the economy starts to stagnate this will lead to political instability of some form. Xi Jin ping would start loosing popular support and all the other opportunistic politicians will use this to try to cease power, as often happens in authoritarian regimes. The best way to at least temporarily gain the people's support and stay in power for a while is to instill a strong sense of nationalism, and the nest way to do this is to unite against a common foe. An invasion of Taiwan could be possible in the near future. Hell, maybe that's what's going on with China's military activities around Taiwan right now. Of course this is just speculation. Who knows what's gonna happen."
You know it‚Äôs getting bad when real estate YouTuber graham Stephan started joining in lol
for algorithm  
"of course won't Collapse same way US doesn't  , "" too big to fall ""
usually need a fuckton level of mismanagment to collapse
and it is a combination of several factors ... this why   china could  Collapse after 10 -12 years !"
"China is definitely too dictatorial to allow ""US depression scenario"". It will try to take all possible forceful measures to mitigate it. Although, the ""mitigation"" part regards only the overall economy (or rather on-paper metrics of the economy). People, however, will suffer, but we just won't hear their scream..."
"I believe there is a need for anti China rhetoric in western countries. I have seen an increase in China doomsday video on YouTube over the last few years. Many people have capitalized on these videos, some even make ridiculous claims about DA CCP censoring their videos even though China doesn‚Äôt allow YouTube in their own country. Funnily these YouTuber gain millions of views and subscribers while claiming to be censored by China. üòÇ"
Chinese economic collapse videos are pumped out every hour for the past 10 years
"I guess we can agree that collapse in 27 days is not likely, but there are way more issues that China is facing, first of all it's prosperity is like Russian military power - all bling, wunderwaffe projects and so on. 
Russian ruble is not a great example of how to handle monetary issues, it's an example that underlying issue will manifest itself one way or another, rather than fighting depreciation, Russian central bank has to fight to keep RUB weaker.
There is just no way to sustain such a real estate bubble as Chinese are not investing in housing in a sense that's usual for westerners. They don't rent it out, not even make them livable, but rather keep them just to wait for another bag holder to buy. Not to mention that these are apartments in toffu dreg projects, not to mention a lot of them are in ghost cities.
Housing prices have dropped by not much, some might tell that it's a good sign, but when government orders not to lower prices at all.. Well then sales collapse. And if prices have dropped it means that realtors are in such a deep hole that they cannot oblige.
Issues with one child policy is just a tip of the iceberg, public health, social benefit/pension systems, tax evasion, lack of environmental standards are issues that are on another level. Manufacturing is cheap when workers don't even get masks to work with hazardous materials, even soil is polluted so much that a lot of Chinese rice is poisoned with cadmium. People eat that shit without knowing. There is a reason why participants of Olympic games were recommended not to eat local food or why CCP have their own grocery shops. They have major and irreversible environmental and food problems for generations to come.
In recent years China was stocking up food supplies. Huge amounts. Very recently warehouses started getting caught on fire, just when auditing was about to get started. Not too difficult to guess that there was little food in those warehouses or some unedible mess with chromium would have been found. All in all it just illustrates massive corruption issues.

Chinese collapse will not be anything like westerners imagine what a collapse is. Chinese might not have food shortages, but who's to check food quality. They might not see negative GDP growth, but who's to check on official numbers. They might not see unemployment, but how many of them will work in coal mines with a pick axe."
"I did wish that an economic hardship would at least help with the fall of the CCP though

Like how it helped with the fall of the USSR"
"what power of autoritarian regime could prevent in short run comes back in long run,economy is still economy and debt is still debt
as Peter Zeihan said China is losing 2 % yearly of its work force meaning there will be less and less people in need of apartment meaning development has seen its peak already
they are on path of decades of stagnation,but certainly worse than Japan"
"I think 3% is a little high as a probability for China's total economic melt down (your dice analogy).

....maybe more like 6s on 3 dice."
Why worry?
"I wonder how many Westerners know, China saved the US economy in 2008 finance crisis., that's why the US owes 1 trillion USD to China now...
US economy would have collapsed long time ago, if China didn't provide help.."
"Collapse 10%. Depends of the peasants, how much more stealing and looting from the ccp can they take before rising!?
Stagnation 90%. Coming decade of low or negative growth. Harsher political crackdowns on descent. Pay cuts, property value collapse and overall standard of living dropping drastically."
"The One Child Policy has already been replaced by two and three children policies years ago, this demographic collapse theory honestly sounds more like the westerners' silent worries spoken outloud - like their ""great replacement"" theory"
This is why Money and Macro is far superior to Economics Explained and other self anointed economic experts
stop promoting china u commy
Is this video a product of the Chinese propaganda mill?
I believe that all of this comes from people who are listening to Peter Zeihan  And not understanding the process of collapse that he is describing which is not economic at all but really political
Do you mean the probability of the union of the three events right?
"The failure of your analisis is to consider that the 3 red lines poped the bubble. If so why does the BOC continue to lower rates? Debt keeps rising in a scarry way. The chinese government tried to rein on the bubble with half measures trying to pass on the responsability on the corporations but that just sparked a crisis so great that they keep rates low and will keep spending to prop up the system. In my opinion you make a shallow analysis. More still you consider the manufacturing superpower of China when the trend is going against it, now that manufacturing is slowly but surely being outsourced elsewhere?! üòâ In the end when you say Russia avoided the collapse of its currency, that's misleading because they simply transformed the rubble into an administrative currency that can't be freely traded. For all the intents and purposes they killed their currency's utility and whenever they try to freely trade it once again the problem will loom again like a HIV infected person when they stop taking the medicine. So you should look carefully into what's happening because what you say here is not that accurate."
"china will never crumble, the communist party however, isn't looking too bright"
Are you using China's official numbers for your predictions? Or some other numbers?
Xi left a message for you. Check your PayPal. The funds have been transferred.
"that specific channel, business basics, go to their video list and like their last 20 videos is just xijinping + map of china lol. if north korea is still goin, china can go for 1000x that"
"Most of this video is correct, except the ending. Demographic effects are overstated. Tech Crackdown was actually to improve competition and breakdown monopolies and bad tech practices. COVID lockdowns also enabled China to maintain its supply side dominance."
Decoupling is becoming reality.  Low tech consumer products will still be manufactured in Asia but the production lines are moving out of the country.   Investor bewares of the unemployment tidal wave that is washing over China.
Some thumbnails also include Elon Musk. As if the guy that claims pyramids were made by aliens could be a legit source.
"Chinas economy has been collapsing every day since I‚Äôve studied Commerce in high school.

That‚Äôs been since 2009.

Chucking shit at the wall and getting it right by luck doesn‚Äôt make you a genius."
"the finance times has predicted its collapse since 1997.
but now, if someone in youtube begins to doubt its collapse, China would actually collapse xd"
"A little glasnost could go a long way. But until then, all we can do is hope."
Click Bait  you cherry pick working towards your desired outcome.  You are YouTube white noise.
It'll be interesting seeing how they handle land bubble pop and population decline compared to Japan. Will China have a similar lost decade or have they learned from Japan's mistakes? They seem to have learned.
"Although you make a strong argument that China won‚Äôt collapse within a month I highly doubt it will recover to pre Covid economic strength. This is based on Peter Zeihan‚Äôs assessment of China‚Äôs long term potential. 

I understand that this video is about the immediate crisis however Zeihan predicted this outcome as the first symptoms of larger issues. So I think you are right and wrong depending on the timeframe you look at. The same with other YouTubers, they may be wrong in the short term but time will vindicate their overall theory. 

They probably should have used different thumbnails though"
"I agree with the core statement of this video. That said, hitting double-anything when roling two dice is equally likely (1 / 6^2 = 1/36). IOW, it does not matter if you aim for double six or double three..."
Let us dream :(
A sports car in the background of a finance channel is a bit of a red flag for me ngl
"I, too, have seen a number of sensationalist videos on YouTube and drawn the same conclusion, namely that a control economy will never be allowed to implode voluntarily. The CCP has all the means it needs at its disposal to prevent a total collapse. The housing bubble will definitely burst and it will also have a marked detrimental effect on the Chinese economy, for which real estate constitutes some 30% of GDP. The fallout from plummeting public confidence in property developers such as Evergrande and the more than 1,000 banks (witness the demonstrations and public unrest) will also hit China hard. I don‚Äôt see this hitting the global economy as hard as some say because while there is still demand from the West for cheap Chinese goods, a lot of companies learned lessons from the damage done to supply chains during the past 2.5 years of COVID lockdowns and have switched suppliers wherever possible, as production in the Far East becomes less reliable."
"If you can't trust YouTube clickbait, what can you trust?"
"thanks. u touched on it quickly. but would love to hear a more in depth scenerio how china compares, and will compare to japan's slowdown from the early 90's"
i like how everybody has got all these theories on the collapse of China.....thing is no one can predict the future.....these are just opiinions.....dont mean shit
We should all report those clickbait videos
They‚Äôre eating sewer oil
"*Here are problems in this video*
I didn't see any data in this video, while the videos referred in the start as China collapse do so precisely 
The geopolitical situation is turning up against China, with US, Japan and EU popping up manufacturing elsewhere, the iphone14 in India, Samsung moving in Vietnam and so on. .
The prolong Covid 19 complete lockdown of major cities creating uncertainty in foreign manufacturers aggravating other issues
The drought that China is facing 
The bad debt China has by investing in uncertain parts of the world"
China will not follow the Japan stagnation model because Japan was servile to the US and followed policies dictated by the US even if it was detrimental to it. China on the other hand is definitely not servile but rather hostile to US intervention. Also don't forget the huge population of China vs that of Japan. You can absorb a lot with 1.4bn people.
Stop being so rational. let economics be fun ü•≤
Love the positioning of scenarios with relative probabilities. Makes a more nuanced case while helping non-PhD in economics viewers understand how to think like an economist. Appreciate this great episode.
How dare you not post something sensational and outlandish!
"China is locking their citizens, allowing banks to rob them, homeless people paying for an unlivable house, can't imagine what China collapsing will look like .. üòÇ"
CHINA ECONOMY STRONG!!!
"China is collapsing as we speak and is collapsing fast, but not as fast as the you tubers are saying."
Finally someone stepping up and bringing this China is collapsing nonsense to a halt! üëåüèº Thanks for the great work!
"Do people realize how hard it is to collapse a national economy? China will only collapse if there's complete chaos. And thus far, there doesn't appear to be any driver towards that. Unrest, perhaps. But manageable, barring a massive black swan event."
"Two things are certain in life: China will prosper, and Feds will print money
Forever and ever and ever..."
Should see Peter Zeihan. Collapse is a distinct possibility. The time frame is not the one advanced.
"This video is wrong.
China is 100% going to collapse, because I don't like China. And my feelings dictate reality."
"One of the biggest red flags I found with all those clickbait videos, was that they all counted down the exact number of days, but they never actually provided any evidence or cited any sources for those dates. I wonder if they'll be getting anyone calling them out on it once that day arrives and China's economy does not in fact collapse."
"I have noticed a lot of channels spreading misinformation about China and Ukraine war. They have almost the same narrative.

It makes one wonder if YouTube is dictating/suggesting more money to YouTubers to spread misinformation and propaganda!"
"You are very incorrect sir....the amount of  leverage in the Chinese system makes the US subprime bubble look small in comparison. Also the cost US bailout was essentially paided for by the world not solely Americans since it still has the world reserve currency status. China ccp government is not trusted by many western nations nor its own people so there is a great deal of rot on the inside. It can collapse, and possibly will in the months and yesrs to come."
You're phenomenal. excellent explanation
If this causes political collapse I'll be very happy. But will feel bad for people if it causes economic collapse.
"Clicking on one of these videos often leads to your entire recommendations becoming anti-china propoganda tbh, there's a whole rabbit whole like the anti-usa propaganda you run into on the internet"
I actually unsubscribed from two channels due to this.
"While I agree with most of the issues addressed, I still want to add a couple more critical issues that no one is talking about. First, the natural disaster in China is worse than what we think. The farmers are already giving up harvesting crops due to severe drought and the hydroelectricity plants are still looking for ways to recover water sources. As we already know, it's just not something that we can fix. Another problem is that China also has been spending a lot of money and the local banks are hesitant more and more about buying the central bank's bonds. They are simply running out of money and we've seen bank-runs in China. Xi is having a major election day coming and it's definitely crucial for him to revive the economy, while supporting Russia and fighting against the U.S. over Taiwan and trade war. Overall, I don't think we will see a collapse in Chinese economy, however, I believe there will be great separation from the rest of the world with China for countless number of issues. And it's already started."
Would love to hear your thoughts on Peters Zeihan potential future for China with the country breaking up in 5 years and mass starvation in 10. Why will the demographic problem that China will be facing in 10 to 15 years not completely orbiterate the countries economy with over half of its workforce retired.
arabic translate next video please
"Hey Money & Macro, you are starting to get a lot of subscribers, congratulations. Hope you spend some of the money you make on a better microphone, thanks ‚ò∫"
Can you make another detailed video on how china's government can boost it's growth rate despite the demographic problems. Also does cracking down on Alibaba and other tech giants actually effective in long run or not.
Ya the bg sound is definitely more quiet more and ur voice sounds deep
"It's interesting how you bean-counting/slide-flippers/sophists are always knows-it-all.
Hmmmm ... ?Well did any of you knows-it-all anticipate Adolf Pootin's blitzkrieg in Ukraine & the beginning of the end of globalism (probably-not)?
I can't wait for the-world recession & oil/gas prices down like a rock (aka economic weapons of mass destruction & killing 2birds with 1stone ;)."
intresting view point
"A Sri Lanka style collapse may still be in the cards depending on the affect this drought has on agriculture and energy imports, also China's ability to export manufactured goods is being threatened by other developing countries doing the same. A trade war with the US could also have a negative impact."
"First of all I never was about to stop watching. You didn't say a single word too much to make your Points.
Second, every double es equally likely. 
The future of any economy is determined by known figures and mechanisms, but also unknown ones. China has a big problem of planing ahead for years based on questionable figures. Lokal leaders report what they had to achieve rather than what they actually did. This tinkles Up.
 China will soon face competition both in cheap labour and in high end manufactoring. 
China has fucked up with all of its neighbours. No help from there."
"Could China pull a rabbit out of the proverbial hat, an Asian hat for that matter? maybe, but it will be very difficult largely because they have yet to transition to a consumer based economy. The Chinese consumer has all of its eggs in the real estate basket. Add to this the macro issues of demographics and you get a picture of where China is headed and it doesn't look pretty. 
Covid, deglobalization, Ukraine war all came at the wrong time for China.  With less international trade and with an increasing energy crisis, China stands to become increasing vulnerable."
I hope it does. They need to be turned into a parking lot.
What about all the civil unrest caused by people losing their life savings from unbuilt homes or people who are still paying a mortgage to a bankrupt company?
"Why Russia Is Making More Money Than Ever, Who Really Killed Sri Lanka‚Äôs Economy? ""Picture of United States President"", How The West Broke Russia's Economy. Yeah click bate is shitty"
"Oh my goodness, finally someone really said it. I mean is quite sickening to read comments like ""this country the next Sri Lanka"" or ""we will ended up like Venezuela or Zimbabwe."" I mean come on while the usual traits are there (corruption, mismanagement), different countries will have different circumstances and cause of why ended up there. 

So yeah, China will be just fine. They just overzealous in doing something."
"The youtube algorithm feeds everyone with these types of videos, i mean i checked most of those channels they couldn't get 50k views when they don't claim bogus things about China's economy. Iceland in 2008 had also massive banking crisis and the government nationalized the falling banks, imposed strong capital controls and in relatively short amount of time they recovered from the recession. @Money & Macro you can make a video on that topic."
"Mannnn thats the most clever title for a video yet Joerie! love it, great take on the China situation "
"I have one word for you, just one, Deglobalisation."
"Yes, I think the long decline scenario is the most likely by far. Chinese growth was already in decline: from 2018 to 2020, India was the fastest growing Asian economy, not China, so there already were a number of pre-COVID pressures on its productivity. With the bad debt that it now faces due to failed Belt and Road initiatives, with the further productivity slow down from zero COVID policies, and the demographic cliff (a minority of demographers think that China's population has ALREADY PEAKED, and the rest think the peak happens in the next decade), there's just not enough wiggle room for China to avoid the consequences of their debt crisis. 

The real question, then, is what happens to a country that saw such explosive growth and then such incredible stagnation? A lot of the unrest in the 1970s in America, and really a good bit of Piketty's research, suggests that when you transition from a fast growing economy to a stagnant one that social pressures become immense. I'm interested to see how this plays out in China's politics - certainly, it will be different due to the authoritarianism of Xi, but what would China do if faced with a lost decade?"
"I imagine all the YouTube videos in China in 2008 warning about an ""American Banking Collapse""!!!"
My math isn't the best but isn't hitting a double 6 just as likely as hitting a double 5 or 4
"Unlike Japan, China is a police state. The economic decline in China will bring about social instability. It might become a vicious cycle of violence and internal conflict which lead to a total collapse of the Chinese economy."
fascinating!
"China's political system isn't immune to collapse any more than the Soviet Union's was. What people misunderstand is that external pressures are not likely to drive a collapse (although they are an indirect force). Internal pressures are the danger to the CCP.

The X days to collapse is  nonsense but so is the China won't collapse idea. There are signs of internal struggle in the CCP. Those capital controls are likely part of the problem as it negatively affects the party membership.   The international damage China has done to itself politically is probably going to do long term damage to the economy increasing the internal pressures on the CCP.

 I think the best comparison with modern China is Saudi Arabia. Their 'social contracts ' are very similar - they both basically bought off their populaces. Modern Chinese expect to be prosperous and have never experienced a recession of any depth. Both the bai lan and bank protests are evidence of the very social disorder the CCP fears. China needs economic growth to fuel its social harmony, not just a soft landing and the situation puts even more internal pressure on the CCP.

Will the CCP collapse? Probably but it will take time - governmental collapses are slow affairs until the very end. Can the CCP save itself? Dubious, foreign capital flight hurts manufacturing and that seems likely to result in a contraction which will bring the CCP itself into turmoil. More political flailing just weakens the CCP from within.

Could I be wrong? Sure but I think I have a better than average chance of being correct . At the very least I know the probability of throwing any given set of doubles is the same!            üòÅ"
"Cold fact: Those ""China's economy is going to collapse"" channels are for dumb people.
If you havent noticed yet, these so-called analysts have been predicting the collapse of China for decades now...LOL. Guess who funded them."
"I see China more like japan tbh, though japan‚Äôs political system is more like the US. China will become more stagnant than fully collapsing."
"The problem with videos on China are pretty simple, people let their emotion guide their analysis. No one bothers to try listen to the other side and the tiny minority on the other side are labelled as CCP shills and bots. People can hate the CCP all you want but that doesn't mean that they should be oblivious to reality. I can imagine some Chinese using a vpn to watch youtube and encountering all these collapse videos. Its only going to make them think that the entire world despises them and wants them to collapse, further cementing the propaganda the CCP has fed them."
"I've been keenly anticipating this video from you, professor, as soon as YouTube's algorithm has pushed these sensationalist videos into my feed. I'm sharing this to help push back the nonsense that has been proliferating.
On the other hand I just wonder now that China is facing a large-scale systemic crisis, were the projections even only a few years ago of its fast growing share of the global economy & making it the dominant world power later this decade now out of date & needing reassesment?"
"the thesis of this video ignores fundamental principles of economics.  fiat currency is spun whole cloth out of the competence and reliability of the government.  Fundamentally then, ""competence"" and ""reliability"" are driven to success by sound government processes working on reliable data aka as ""reality"".  The government must be in touch with reality in order to ""steer its course"". 

In that regard, China is more like the USSR than any other large government.  The Winnie the Pooh situation gives insight into its unsound fundamental processes that are not fully concerned about reliable data or reality.  The PRC is more concerned with making the correct people happy then it is with reality.  In essence then, the PRC itself is already in a competency bubble.  There is no telling when or how hard it will collapse, but it should be something similar to the USSR."
thank you for existing on this platform
New based channel just dropped
I agree that the most likely outcome for China is Japan style stagnation. The effects of that will be drastically different because China is a totalitarian regime and Japan is a democracy. If China ruling class wants to be in power they need foreign capital to fuel their growth to show its citizens that they know what they are doing and their situation is the best they could have hoped (increasing higher living standard). If there is no big growth and even stagnation (maybe stagflation I doubt that though) people will undoubtedly start to protest in the same way in some cities there were protest in front of banks. And artificial manipulation will obviously drive away foreign investments in the same way that happened in Russia when foreigners could sell and nationals had to convert their foreign reserves into rubles and the stock market was closed for weeks. You can't get investments if your credibility is low.
"THANK YOU. I‚Äôm sick of these videos, great explanation!
EDIT: regarding Japan style, apparently China is worse off in reproduction in the short term than Japan! Crazy how much damage one policy can do."
These YouTubers need to put money on their claims. What china may see is some form of quantitative easing akin to the aftermath of 2008.
What if China actually invades Taiwan? What would that do the world economy?
"I think everyone wants a power upset and either a collapse or a war.  Right now, there's a lot of unrest and stagnation, and rightly some of the unrest is caused by the stagnation.

I don't think total collapse is possible anymore, but I also don't feel comfortable saying this and then obviously being wrong."
"Yeah, the last time a major yet authoritarian power collapsed back in 1991, everything went happily ever after right............................RIIIIIIIIIIGHT!!!!!"
"Yes most of these videos are just clickbait. I wanted to watch something from you, great you made a video on this."
It's going to be like Japan. Stagflation. The demographic situation is key in this. Capital controls will drag this out.
You should invest in Evergrande then. Lol
You didn't even touch on the agricultural and environmental challenges their facing. The largest rivers in the country running dry and heatwave causing power shortages. These will be the news stories we'll here about because without water you don't have anything.
I love China :D They are among the best in the world in Badminton.
Rolling a double five is exactly as likely as rolling a double six: 1 in 36. You probably meant to say rolling 10 (3 in 36) is more likely than rolling 12 (1 in 36)
Great video and explanation! Thanks for the content!
"You are pure air in the midst of a smoggy city, clear water in the desert

I am not crazy! I was thinking the same thing, and I was starting to actually worry on the sheer amount of content creators that were sharing those clickbaity titles

I will now proceed to un-subsribe to all of them!!!"
"I also felt that something was off when I saw in a few finance channels that ""China's economy is going to collapse"" and I was like; WHAT!? CHINA'S ECONOMY IS GOING TO COLLAPSE!? IN LESS THAN 30 DAYS!?"
"you gotta keep two things in mind, this is the same party that got 60 million killed during the  GLF and the Culture revolution, secondly only trust of correct economic management is keeping up stability in china"
"For China, stagnation IS collapse. A switch for decades of high growth to stagnation so suddenly is a death sentence for Xi."
"Youtube is recommending so many ""china collapsing"" videos from Youtubers I have never watched that I'm getting very suspicious its a US government psy-ops.  Somebody get me a tinfoil hat."
"I think you hit the nail on the head, spoken like a true economist!"
Yeah I never understood why so many youtbers were saying China was collapsing. Like so what people stop paying their mortgage that just means China would just loan the banks money they need. Owe that will cause inflation that's fine China could loosen and restrict capital flows as needed and have enough foreign currency reserves to buy back their currency if need be. Don't get me wrong the communist party will lose some political capital but it will likely get that back over the long hall.
The biggest problem for China is most of the funding local governments get is from property.  But I am sure when the local governments start to struggle the head of the government will just bail them out.  America already does the same thing.  They bail out most cities in the US because people expect all of these city features in rural areas.  (Sewage being a big one). So every time infrastructure needs replaced the state/federal government steps up and bails out the city.
This guy looks like he just woke up after a hangover and he is just ready for another one!
This headline just shows that western capitalists don't understand China's economy
"Lol at the logic flaws. The first part of your video alludes that because China's situation is different than the previous situations, and they failed, that China will not fail? This = only 1 type of failure??? Big questions my man. And then, there cannot be a bank run because they are state owned and the state can supply the money? Friend. That is collapse. Unless, you really think that M1 = M4 + bonds and other assets, to include derivatives and stupid stuff like NFTs?  The M1 in the United States is what, maybe like 3-4 trillion? Or about $10,000 per person? Yeah, I'm sure that the US could squash a bank run of that size, not without pain, but....to think that a country could support  bank run by supplying ALL the currency that people think they have? Sending the M1 from 3 trillion to 40 trillion? I'm glad everything is hunky-dory in your world, and other people's world where even though there is 150 trillion in real assets, there is only a few trillion in currency, but somehow those numbers don't matter."
Thanks for covering this. I've also seen those thumbnails all over YouTube and even had a friend declare the same presumably based on one of these clickbaity videos. I'll send him this.
"No fire in thumbnail, refuse to watch"
This is all about banking but it misses a lot. No china is not gone inside of the next month but they are in no way on an upward trajectory.
"I was waiting for you to address this one, thanks xD
Groeten uit Groningen!"
DAMN! You‚Äôre getting my hopes down. China NEEDS to collapse in order for world peace to be restored. China is a threat to the whole world and only its complete and total collapse can save us from them.
"As the main international rival, much like the USSR before it, so many insecurities are projected onto it. Those in the US project a 2008 style recession as the Us teeters towards another recession. Those in Europe focus on it's energy dependence on coal and gas and see fuel inflation as it's downfall. One prominent UK analyst repeatedly predicts secessionist movements just as Scotland and NI move towards independence. The West as a whole motions towards treatment of  Uighurs after decades of anti-Islamic counter-terrorism in the Middle East and domestically. Neo-colonial powers point at the Belt and Road initiative. 

There is a complete and utter failure to take China on it's own terms and to actually recon with it."
"This Glut and its subsequent pop is just one of pieces of wider problem that I think is gonna bring PRC to their colapse. You know, a lot of policies implemented by CCP are overreactionist and late to the party. For better understanding look how long it took China to cancel One child policy or implement rules for developers. They fall on one thing only and that is the lack of dissent in govt that in democracy serves exactly the purpose to prevent such rushed and self-liquidating measures as One child policy."
"China will collapse, obviously. But the CCP is going to continue to push the can down the road as long as they can, while continuing to downplay their numbers and data. The CCP can make up anything and do anything they want with the numbers and news, so they can survive a little longer. But without a doubt, China is collapsing right before us, just slowly. A storm is turning more and more each day."
"None of this does anything to address the multiple icebergs china is facing. It's not just Housing, its collapsing demographics, reshoring of companies, increasingly millitant neighbors AND housing. I'd also question how effective these policies would be, but this is a yt comments section not a econ form"
"THANK YOU. Christ, seeing so many fools making videos about China's ""collapse"" this year was pissing me off."
"I heard their agriculture output is also low, because of continuous drought."
"Definitely agree with this.  The long-run issues are more interesting in my opinion.  Some of them (e.g. population decline, rising dependency ratios) are faced by many developed countries as well."
"Something I think needs to be considered is how badly the global economy may do. If food, fuel, and fertilizer continue to be expensive into 2023 then a stagnant middle income economy may not do so well anymore. Though it remains to be seen what natural resources Russia can provide."
Not gonna lei was waiting for you to finally make a video on this subject
"""China's Economy Will Collapse""   I heard about it decades ago.  Only those jealous and envy of China's success will only buy it.   ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Thank you for tackling this trend. These videos seemed incredibly sensational when I saw those videos pop up
It is so rare to find an honest economist like you these days.
"Worth noting that one of the finance YTers who pushed the China will collapse is Patrick Boyle who was a guest of M&M. 

His ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù caused me to unsub his channel. Similarly I unsubbed other YTers who were conveniently pushing the China collapse story right as the US was ramping up tensions against China geopolitically. 

Happy to see that Joeri looks at these economic stories rationally. His Evergrande video is fantastic btw."
"This is probably one of the very few serious economics channels that is informed & truth seeking and without ideological blinkers. Which is why im a paid sub!!  You also seem somewhat humble about what you don't know. Thank you I appreciate your work a lot, Joeri."
"100% agree. A 3rd factor is most of China's debt is held in it's own currency, not foreign denominated. The only plausible 'collapse' would be political, but, my thesisfor years has been that they have been ramping up totalitarian measuresand anti foreign sentiment precisely to prepare for the deleveraging of the property bubble as it steps on so many toes. The mortgage strikes are big but not enough to rattle authorities, they will cautiously stimulate and restructure debts.
 Big question is how do they drive up productivity again without feeding back into a housing bubble? They need to follow through with the promise of a property tax, a land value tax would be even better."
Pfft! Wallstreet have been warning about China collapse for how many years now
"So... YouTube (like the internet as a whole) has alot of young people who personally haven't lived all that much, but have managed to develop many nuance-free, strong opinions without doing legitimate research in support of said opinions.

Who knew?"
I do not really think this is plausible but a poor nice try....
From nonsense to nuance! Keep up the great work! üçä
"not in the short term. On the other hand just because china is not the same as the US does not mean anything.

Those panic videos are just click bait.
I guess what you forgot is a risk of recession in the west that will spill over to China and that will make things in the west worse etc."
"the two sides of a coin are important, thanks for putting diversity to the discusion. Since nobody knows the future the more opinions are added to the debate the better understanding of the situation we have."
"Thank you so much, its nice that you actually did some real research. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç"
"Comment this: Chinese local government is funded mainly by leasing land for property developers, not by taxes. Now this model is becoming difficult to maintain, if not impossible. This will add cards to the collapsing house of cards China is."
"Really funny to see people constantly switch between ""China is an all-powerful force that's gonna take over the world"" and ""China is so weak and incompetent that it's gonna collapse any minute now."" People have been ""predicting"" that it's gonna collapse for decades now."
"Excellent analysis, although I think you underestimate the demographic impact that China will not be able to grow out of."
"While all your points make sense, you should never underestimate the stupidity of the CCP and especially their emperor's."
"Glad you put out a video on this,  balanced videos on economics YouTube are a rarity,  small improvement  on great videos  would  be to put source links description,  great work"
"FDI has slowed to a trickle, their real estate sector is in freefall, they are the largest importer of energy inputs on the planet and prices arent dropping.   They found out awhile back that they are more vulnerable to sanctions than nearly any other big player in the world markets. Toss in their demographics and its a dumpster fire. Just saying, a full collapse or a slow spiral, the results will likely be the same. I do agree that putting a date on it all is dumb."
"For a really good insight on China, check out Uncle China Mikey, LeLe Farley, Laowhy86, SerpentZA, and Laolei. These guys have all lived in China, speak Mandarin fluently, and thus know what China is like firsthand. I highly recommend their work. You'll get an insight as to what the psyche of most Chinese people is, how they are just trying to get by, and while the economy is not doing too well, they don't really care about regime change and whatnot, they just want to live another day, for the most part. The CCP has way too much power for them to collapse anytime soon. The only way any kind of breakdown of the CCP happens is if all faith in the government is lost, and if something borderline apocalyptic happens, which isn't going to happen anytime soon."
"Thank you for the great video. Aside from having informative videos that explain all this stuff in an accessible manner, you've also helped me avoid sensational ""DISASTER INCOMING EVERYBODY PANIC NOW"" videos about economics on youtube. Once again, thanks for the great videos, and please keep them coming."
"Do you think all country are headed for a Japanese stagnation?  I mean, unless we make extraordinary development in automation, population decline is creeping on all countries."
"I'm no great fan of the communist parties around the world, but thank you for debunking and deflating the overarrogant, Dunning-Krugers afflicted doomsayers of Youtube. The problem is the world economy rely too much on China, just like the US banking system. If they collapsed, we collapsed. They are not going to let them falls as quickly as 30 days."
"also, if they were going to invade Taiwan they would need about 10 times the landing vehicles and a way of hacking all the missiles and drones and planes."
"What does it even mean for a country to collapse? Was 2008 a collapse in the USA? Probably not but it was not great. We are still feeling it now. But USA is not China. China is a poor country when looked at per capita. Even a mild recession might push them down a very perilous path. Add repatriation of high tech factories, much more expansive food an energy (all three are core to developing country actually developing) and the future of China looks grim. The growth monster will not be back for a LONG time."
clickbait bollox
China collapse when?! - points at wristwatch.
Thank you for getting rid of the shake effect on the video
"Yeah of course, a large part of their economy (real estate) is one giant Ponzi scheme. Lmao."
"You certainly know this, but you've got some pretty bad sound issues on this video."
"It's not going to collapse, it's going to get stuck in the middle income gap.  It's just going to have flat growth, or shrink.  Their collapse will come later because of their one child policy."
"YouTube is full of doomsday videos period. Same with the stock market, the US economy, the EU, etc. We live in an age of stupidity where it pays to make sensationalist, fearful, clickbait thumbnails without any sense of intellectual integrity."
I knew it from the first day . Western Propaganda as always
"I mean duh it won‚Äôt collapse, I just wanna know how good/bad it will become in a few decades.

(Maybe I should watch the video first)"
I've always saw those videos that China's economy was about to collapse in my recommendations but I was always sceptical but I didn't know why. So thank you for making this video
i've seen videos about how soon china will collapse too many times!
I knew it from the first day . Western Propaganda as always
