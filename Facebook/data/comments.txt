Who knows about any other country that has as frequent country wide power outages as we do?
Westlands and Loresho no power yet.
But as usual we will get a half cooked explanation where KPLC will portrait themselves as poor victims and they'll continue as before.
This is the company, where if you report a power failure you may get foolish responses like "but it is raining, you need to expect the power to go off". So what do we expect?
