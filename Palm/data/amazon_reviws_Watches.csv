There are many articles online about the Timex Scout 40. There are also many video reviews. And there are the many reviews here on Amazon.

I'm not sure what I can add to all that. But I'll try.

I'll focus on the luminous hour and minute hands, the second hand, and the accuracy. Some of what I'm writing is based on the way I use the watch and some on info I've gathered from the articles and videos I mentioned above.

I'll start with the luminous hands since that's why I bought the watch.

None of the current watches I wear have luminous hands. Indiglo on the digital Timex and the LED on the digital Casio can light up the whole watch face. They are activated with a simple press of a button, typically a momentary push. But I wanted a watch where the face or at least the hands are continuously illuminated in a dark environment.

I've learned through research online that there are different types of lume that can be applied to watch hands and different grades within each type. I'd like one day to get a watch with tritium tubes illuminating the hands. Till then, the luminescent hands on a Timex does the job.

I generally have a strong light source on me such as an LED headlamp. I find I can charge up the watch hands in a few moments from that light.

The hands glow bright immediately after charging but become progressively dimmer over time. However, the hands are still legible even hours later in a darkened area with dark adapted eyes. That works for me. And if needed, the hands can be quickly recharged with the portable LED light that's always nearby.

A number of reviewers have mentioned that their Scout 40 second hand does not align with the dial markers as it jumps in one second intervals. Apparently, this is an issue across watch brands for quartz watches. One reviewer on Amazon said he exchanged his Scout watch because the second hand did not align and the exchange watch's second hand did align.

One video said the user can align the second hand if necessary by taking the watch apart and nudging the second hand. I might try that if needed on a future purchase. But as it is the second hand on the watch I received lines up nicely.

There is still a parallax issue when the watch is viewed at certain angles. It's to be expected. The second hand sits above the other hands. One way watch designers minimize parallax is by bending the hands towards the watch face. (Although it might be the primary reason for the bending is to conform with the curve of a domed crystal.) But that's a tricky fix, apparently, that is done by hand and not something that is common. In the case of the Timex Scout, it would be overkill.

The accuracy of the Timex Scout according to one website is plus or minus 20 seconds per month, although so far I could not find that spec listed anywhere by Timex.

Some owners mention that their Scout watches don't seem to be gaining or losing much time at all. I had a Timex Chronograph like that. I think it was off like 2 seconds a month. The cheapest Casio I could find just to have a backup watch is also amazingly accurate.

This Timex Scout is within the plus/minus 20 second a month range. I haven't let it run yet for say a week without resetting to get a better idea of the accuracy. I may update this review if and when I get around to better determining the accuracy.

Excellent watch

I am a tinkerer, and my wife knows I love watches. I told her that I loved them when we met 24 years ago, and when in doubt about gifts, she defaults to a watch. I have Rolexes, Movados, Patek Philippe, a Breitling, an Omega, and (the last gift, for my 60th birthday), a Chopard. She also bought me a Seiko a few years ago. The reason for the background isn't to brag on my watch collection... In fact, when I told her I liked watches, I meant that I like to wear them, but a Seiko or Timex is more my speed. So, I wore the Seiko when doing yard work, rebuilding engines, tinkering under the hood of my antique cars. My son was helping me one day in the garage and he said, ""Dad, why are you wearing a $2500 watch while banging around under the hood of your truck?"" I almost fell over. My last Seiko was about $100... I had no idea it was anywhere near that expensive!

So, I immediately went on Amazon and bought this little jewel. I wear it routinely when tinkering. I also wear it to work in an office setting, while swimming, and I even went scuba diving with it instead of my trusty Rolex Submariner (my first gift from my wife). The Timex is rated to 50 meters, and we went down to about 35 meters (120 ft) and it was just fine. I could read it easily at that depth as well and it didn't get any condensation or water inside the case. The watchband is made of a canvas like material, and I was able to rinse off the saltwater after the dive.

GIven the abuse I have heaped on the watch, I can assure you it will not let you down whether wearing it to work, banging around on an antique truck, or even exploring a reef off of St Maarten!

Another Excellent Timex Watch!

My last Timex large faced watch had died - mostly, if I am honest, due to needing a new battery that no one in my town could replace since our only jewelry store had closed some years before.

I had been saving for an Apple watch that I wanted mostly because of the latest health features.
In reality I was not keen on having a watch that included more “connectivity” and was also not keen at having a timepiece that needed ‘charging’ either. So after some more thought I decided that an Apple watch was not really something I needed to spend money on and that another Timex would be a better choice for me.

I wanted a light colored, large, face with a silver bezel…and a date would be nice to have. So many faces were dark, but then I landed on this light faced Expedition choice. The black bezel is not really an issue and I am very happy with my choice to buy another Timex watch that is modestly priced, and durable. I like slip through bands so that I can buy watchbands that coordinate….especially pleased with a plaid Timex replacement band found here on Amazon.

Buying another Timex large faced watch was a great choice for me!

Easy to read and use, simple style

The style of this watch face (font, spacing, configuration) is incredibly simple and it is easy to parse at a quick glance. I've typically worn digital watches for this reason and avoided watch faces where I need to spend any more than a second to know what time it is. The only complaints that I have so far are that the watch band is not very comfortable and the light easily triggers when the back of my left hand is pushed back towards it. The light isn't a huge deal, but I will likely change out the watch band.
I've worn this watch in the shower and the pool and haven't seen any problems with water resistance either. In addition, I've worn this watch everywhere and do not see a single scratch on the glass which I'm very happy about compared to many plastic/plexiglass windows I've had on watches such as my previous digital Casio.
Overall, I'm happy with the watch and the simplicity of the piece and the fact that it has held up really well in all conditions!
