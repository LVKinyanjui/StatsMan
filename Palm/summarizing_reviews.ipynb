       "'Tin Can Sailor\\nVINE VOICE\\nExcellent watch\\nReviewed in the United States on September 15, 2023\\nColor: Green Slip-ThruVerified Purchase\\nI am a tinkerer, and my wife knows I love watches. I told her that I loved them when we met 24 years ago, and when in doubt about gifts, she defaults to a watch. I have Rolexes, Movados, Patek Philippe, a Breitling, an Omega, and (the last gift, for my 60th birthday), a Chopard. She also bought me a Seiko a few years ago. The reason for the background isn\\'t to brag on my watch collection... In fact, when I told her I liked watches, I meant that I like to wear them, but a Seiko or Timex is more my speed. So, I wore the Seiko when doing yard work, rebuilding engines, tinkering under the hood of my antique cars. My son was helping me one day in the garage and he said, \"Dad, why are you wearing a $2500 watch while banging around under the hood of your truck?\" I almost fell over. My last Seiko was about $100... I had no idea it was anywhere near that expensive!\\n\\nSo, I immediately went on Amazon and bought this little jewel. I wear it routinely when tinkering. I also wear it to work in an office setting, while swimming, and I even went scuba diving with it instead of my trusty Rolex Submariner (my first gift from my wife). The Timex is rated to 50 meters, and we went down to about 35 meters (120 ft) and it was just fine. I could read it easily at that depth as well and it didn\\'t get any condensation or water inside the case. The watchband is made of a canvas like material, and I was able to rinse off the saltwater after the dive.\\n\\nGIven the abuse I have heaped on the watch, I can assure you it will not let you down whether wearing it to work, banging around on an antique truck, or even exploring a reef off of St Maarten!\\nRead more\\n12 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nReport'"
